Set aside.\nCore the strawberry stems, and cut each strawberry into large bites or keep whole if preferred. Both options work great. Place the strawberries into a large mixing bowl with corn starch, sugar, lemon juice, and stir to coat.\nSpread evenly into the baking dish. It’s ok if it’s not in a single layer. Strawberries bake really fast, even if they overlap. Set aside.\nIn another mixing bowl, mix flour of choice, rolled oats, coconut flakes (or chopped nuts), sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.\nRub in soft coconut oil or softened dairy-free butter with fingertips until it forms a breadcrumb-like texture. Start with 5 tablespoons of soft coconut oil and add the extra one if too dry.\nSprinkle over the strawberries in the pan.\nBake for 25-30 minutes or until the fruits are cooked, bubbly, and the top is cooked and crispy.\nServe with a dollop of dairy-free ice cream or whipped cream."

Transfer pork to a plate.\nReduce the heat to medium; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Return pork to the pot; stir in chicken broth, green chiles, diced tomatoes with juice, and tomatillo salsa. Season with oregano and ground cloves. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.\nAfter 20 minutes, transfer 2 cups of soup (without any pork pieces) to a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Purée until smooth, then pour back into the cooking pot. This will create a thicker texture for your chili and will eliminate some of the chunky bits of chiles. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender, at least 35 minutes more.\n\n\n\n\nRoasted green chilies"

    "text": "Instructions\nMade with chickpea flour that is popular in southern France -the loose, pancake-like batter comes together in less than a minute: Simply whisk together chickpea flour, water, olive oil, turmeric, salt, and pepper.\nTraditionally the batter is poured into a cast-iron skillet and baked in a wood-burning oven to make a large socca with a blistered top and a smoky flavor. But in a home oven, this technique pro duced socca that was dry and limp. So we ditched the oven for the higher heat of the stovetop, which gave us crispy, golden brown socca. But flipping the skillet-size socca wasn’t as easy as we’d hoped. We solved this problem by making several smaller flatbreads instead.\nAs an added bonus, these elegant flatbreads had a higher ratio of crunchy crust to tender interior. To comple ment our savory flatbreads, we came up with a flavorful topping of Swiss chard, dried apricots, and toasted pistachios that was earthy, sweet, and delicious. We used the warm spices cumin and allspice to balance the bright notes of the chickpea flour.\n\nFOR THE BATTER Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Whisk chickpea flour, salt, pepper, and turmeric together in bowl. Slowly whisk in water and 3 tablespoons oil until combined and smooth.\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add ½ cup batter to skillet, tilting pan to coat bottom evenly. Reduce heat to medium and cook until crisp at edges and golden brown on bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip socca and continue to cook until second side is browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire rack in warm oven and repeat, working with 2 teaspoons oil and ½ cup batter at a time.\nFOR THE TOPPING Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until soft ened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and allspice and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in Swiss chard and apricots and cook until chard is wilted, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in pistachios and vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each cooked socca with ½ cup chard mixture, slice, and serve."

Dip each side of the bread into the custard, giving each side a few seconds in the mixture. Transfer the soaked bread immediately to the hot pan. Cook the toast until golden on each side, about 2-3 minutes per side.\nIn the meantime, prepare the caramelized pineapple. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter or coconut oil in a large saute pan. Coat each side of the pineapple slices in sugar, and immediately place in the hot butter. Cook the pineapple until starting to caramelize on one side, about 5 minutes. Stir and carefully flip the pineapple slices over, continue to cook for about another 4-5 minutes until the pineapple is softened and caramelized. Juice should release from the pineapple and mix with the caramel to form a lovely, golden caramel sauce.\nServe the toast warm and topped with the caramelized pineapple and some of the sauce. For additional serving ideas, you can also top with macadamia nuts, toasted coconut, whipped coconut cream, and/or maple or coconut syrup.\nNotes:\nTo make this recipe dairy-free, simply use coconut oil in place of butter. It will work fine as a 1:1 substitute.\nTo lighten-up this recipe, skip the caramelized part and top with fresh tropical fruit like mango, pineapple, and papaya.\nWant it extra coconut-y? Add in a splash of coconut extract or top with whipped coconut cream and plenty of toasted coconut."
