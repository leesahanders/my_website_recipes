Mushrooms\n\nsalt, pepper, dash of thyme\n\n\nMake a custard: Beat well together\n\n\n4 eggs\n1 ½ cups milk\n3 Tbs. flour\n¼ tsp. salt\n¼ tsp. dry mustard\n\n\nPour custard over mushroom layer.\nSprinkle with paprika. Bake at 375º for 40-45 minutes, or until sold in the center when jiggled.\n\nVariations - Substitute cheddar cheese for Swiss - Use fresh tomato slices instead of mushrooms. (Tomatoes don’t need to be sautéed first) - Substitute 1 cup chopped scallions for the onion. - Add 1 tsp. prepared horseradish.\nDr. McCarty’s Changes 1. Use Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. 2. Use any kinds of cheese, but best if you use at least two types of cheese. 3. It is very important to sauté whatever vegetables you use before putting them on top of the cheese layer."

Set aside.\nCore the strawberry stems, and cut each strawberry into large bites or keep whole if preferred. Both options work great. Place the strawberries into a large mixing bowl with corn starch, sugar, lemon juice, and stir to coat.\nSpread evenly into the baking dish. It’s ok if it’s not in a single layer. Strawberries bake really fast, even if they overlap. Set aside.\nIn another mixing bowl, mix flour of choice, rolled oats, coconut flakes (or chopped nuts), sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.\nRub in soft coconut oil or softened dairy-free butter with fingertips until it forms a breadcrumb-like texture. Start with 5 tablespoons of soft coconut oil and add the extra one if too dry.\nSprinkle over the strawberries in the pan.\nBake for 25-30 minutes or until the fruits are cooked, bubbly, and the top is cooked and crispy.\nServe with a dollop of dairy-free ice cream or whipped cream."

    "text": "Instructions\nMade with chickpea flour that is popular in southern France -the loose, pancake-like batter comes together in less than a minute: Simply whisk together chickpea flour, water, olive oil, turmeric, salt, and pepper.\nTraditionally the batter is poured into a cast-iron skillet and baked in a wood-burning oven to make a large socca with a blistered top and a smoky flavor. But in a home oven, this technique pro duced socca that was dry and limp. So we ditched the oven for the higher heat of the stovetop, which gave us crispy, golden brown socca. But flipping the skillet-size socca wasn’t as easy as we’d hoped. We solved this problem by making several smaller flatbreads instead.\nAs an added bonus, these elegant flatbreads had a higher ratio of crunchy crust to tender interior. To comple ment our savory flatbreads, we came up with a flavorful topping of Swiss chard, dried apricots, and toasted pistachios that was earthy, sweet, and delicious. We used the warm spices cumin and allspice to balance the bright notes of the chickpea flour.\n\nFOR THE BATTER Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Whisk chickpea flour, salt, pepper, and turmeric together in bowl. Slowly whisk in water and 3 tablespoons oil until combined and smooth.\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add ½ cup batter to skillet, tilting pan to coat bottom evenly. Reduce heat to medium and cook until crisp at edges and golden brown on bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip socca and continue to cook until second side is browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire rack in warm oven and repeat, working with 2 teaspoons oil and ½ cup batter at a time.\nFOR THE TOPPING Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until soft ened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and allspice and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in Swiss chard and apricots and cook until chard is wilted, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in pistachios and vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each cooked socca with ½ cup chard mixture, slice, and serve."

Cover and cook until the chicken is falling off the bones, 6 to 8 hours on low, or 5 to 6 hours on high. Uncover, discard the chicken bones, then cook on high until the gumbo thickens slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve over rice, garnished with parsley."

Pour 1/4 of the batter into a hot pan greased with butter or pam spray. Cook for 2 minutes until golden, flip and cook 1 minute on the other side. Repeat with the rest of the batter. Serve with sugar free syrup (or any syrup of your choice) and fresh berries. A surprisingly satisfying substitute for the real thing. Tastes like skinny fried cheesecakes! Even if you aren’t watching your carbs these are a delicious departure from the traditional doughy stack of pancakes. And you won’t have the sleepy feeling that usually comes afterwards!"

Put roasted nuts in a clean towel and rub off skins. Discard skins and let nuts cool.\nStep 2 In a food processor, grind nuts with half the rice flour until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add remaining rice flour and salt and pulse briefly.\nStep 3 Cream sugar and butter in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon for a minute or two until pale and thick. Add nut mixture and combine until dough comes together. If it seems crumbly, add 1 to 2 tablespoons softened butter or a little cold water.\nStep 4 Press dough evenly into a 10-inch French tart pan; use half the dough for the sides and half for the bottom. Prick bottom with a fork and freeze for 30 minutes (or several days if desired).\nStep 5 Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake chilled tart shell about 15 minutes until lightly brown. Cool.\nStep 6 Make the cranberry curd: Put cranberries, sugar and orange juice and peel in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until cranberries have popped and softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a food mill or medium mesh sieve and press cooking liquid into a bowl. Whisk the butter into the warm liquid.\nStep 7 Put eggs and egg yolks into a bowl and beat lightly. Slowly whisk a cup of warm cranberry liquid into the eggs to temper, then combine both and whisk together. Wipe out pot if necessary, return liquid to pot and cook over low heat until nearly bubbling and thickened, about 10 minutes. If using immediately, let cool to room temperature. If working ahead, cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap (press wrap against curd) and refrigerate. (Curd may be cooked up to 1 day ahead.)\nStep 8 Pour cooled cranberry curd into the cooled prebaked tart shell and smooth top with a spatula. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes to set curd. Cool on a rack. Store at room temperature for up to 2 days."

You should have about 2 cups. Using the back of your knife, scrape downwards along the cobs and add the milky substance that oozes out to the corn kernels. Discard the cobs.\nHeat a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced bacon. Once it has rendered a few tablespoons fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat, leaving the bacon in the pot.\nAdd the butter, onion, bell pepper, thyme, cumin, and turmeric and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, until the onion and pepper are tender but not browned. Add the corn kernels, potatoes, and stock, turn up the heat, cover, and boil vigorously for about 10 minutes. Some of the potatoes will fall apart, but most should retain their shape.\nUse the back of your spoon to smash a bit of the corn and potatoes against the side of the pot to thicken the chowder. Reduce the heat to medium and season the chowder with salt and pepper. Stir the cornstarch mixture and slowly pour it into the pot, stirring constantly. As soon as the chowder has come back to a boil and thickened slightly, remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.\nLadle the chowder into cups or bowls and sprinkle with the chopped chives. Serve immediately or let it sit at room temperature for up to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld. If you aren’t serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool, then cover and refrigerate for up to a few days. Reheat the chowder over low heat and but don’t let it boil."

Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Purée until smooth, then pour back into the cooking pot. This will create a thicker texture for your chili and will eliminate some of the chunky bits of chiles.

    "text": "Instructions\nINSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS\nPlace all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it’s frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated. It’s best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don’t shred it. Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles"

Add broccoli and boil rapidly.\nYou will want to slice your goat cheese at this point if you’re making the fancy version. Dip the knife into the boiling hot water before each slice for even smooth cuts. Cut two slices of goat cheese per bowl being served. After cutting, use the hot smooth side of your knife to smooth one side of the cheese slices for appearance.\nYour broccoli is finished cooking when you can pierce it with little or no effort. Remove the stock pan from the stove burner. DO NOT POUR THE WATER OUT! Use a slotted spoon to add broccoli to a blender but be careful because it’s boiling hot! Pour enough of the water left over from cooking the broccoli to fill the blender half way. Add a pinch (or more) of salt. Use several pulses on your blender to break the broccoli up and then puree for several seconds.\nIf you are making the fancy version, add five walnuts to the bottom of a shallow bowl and then place pieces of goat cheese on top of them.\nPour soup into shallow bowl. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and serve at once! Delicious!"

Press the “pressure cook” button.\nMARINATE GROUND BEEF\n\nPrepare the vegetables: Finely dice the onion. Thinly slice the green onions and save some for garnish. Finely chop the mushrooms. Finely chop the chili peppers (if using).\nMake the bulgogi marinade: In a small container, mix together the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, oyster sauce, minced garlic, sesame oil, black pepper, and MSG (if using).\nTo a large mixing bowl, add the ground beef, mushrooms, and marinade. Mix well. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 15 minutes or overnight.\n\nPREPARE BROCCOLI\n\nCut off the florets. Cut them into smaller bite-sized pieces.\nBring a pot of water to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, lightly season with salt and add the broccoli. Blanch for 1 to 2 minutes. Shock them in some ice water. Drain well.\n\nMAKE GROUND BEEF BULGOGI\n\nIn a large wok (or pan), heat the oil over medium-high heat. Once it’s heated, add the white parts of the green onions and onion. Saute for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.\nAdd the beef mixture. Spread it out and give it some time to caramelize. Once you’ve got some sear on the bottom, flip and break it into small pieces. Keep stirring it around until the beef is cooked through. This will take about 12 minutes.\nTurn the heat off. Add the chili peppers (if using), the rest of the green onions, and the sesame oil. Give it a final mix.\n\nASSEMBLE\n\nDivide the rice into microwave-safe containers. (Because I’m more into muscle gain, I divided it into 5 servings, but if this is too many calories for you, you can divide it into 6 or 7 .)\nMake a barrier with broccoli. (Make sure the broccoli is really well drained.) Add the ground beef bulgogi. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Optionally, serve with kimchi on the side."

This will be used to make the orejitas (masa balls).\nTo make the orejitas, use the masa to make small balls, about the size of ping-pong balls, and make a dent in the center with your thumb.\nIn a medium saucepan, boil 2½ cups of water. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and add the orejitas; let them cook for 10 minutes. Once the 10 minutes is over, leave the orejitas in the pot. You will use them later on.\nIn a blender, combine ½ cup of masa with 1½ cups of water and blend until there is no masa visible. Set aside; this will be used in the beans.\nIn a soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon of lard or oil over medium-low heat. Add the sliced onion and garlic; saute until golden brown. Add the 3 springs of epazote, the beans, and the 4 cups of broth. Using a strainer, pass the masa-water mixture from the blender into the pot of beans, removing any lumps that may have formed. The color of the broth will become a bit lighter. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, then add the masa orejitas. Bring the pot to a simmer, and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings, then serve."

The best ratio for the gluten-free flour blends in this book (see page 19) is 3:2:1.2 - but it might be different for other blend compositions.\nBecause you leave the butter pieces relatively large, the dough is initially (quite unsuccessfully) kept together only by the added water, which is why it will look incredibly dry and crumbly. As you knead, however, small portions of the butter melt from the heat of your hands, helping the dough to come together.\nThe secret to making perfectly flaky, buttery pie crust lies in keeping the butter pieces large and in several rounds of folding to create a rudimentary form of lamination. This, in turn, makes the dough easier to handle and the baked crust extra flaky. When making the pie crust, you may be tempted to add more water. Resist: adding more water will just make the crust tough. Instead, keep kneading and see the pastry transform into a beautiful dough (see Note #2). This recipe makes enough for a 23cm pie with both a base and a full pastry lid.\n\nIn a large bowl, mix together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, xanthan gum and salt.\nAdd the cold butter and toss it in the flour until each piece is coated.\nSquish each cube of butter between your fingers to form small, thin sheets of butter. Be sure to check you’ve squished all the butter pieces before adding the water.\nAdd the cold water and mix well with a fork or spatula until the dough starts coming together. After you’ve added all the water, the dough will still look very dry - don’t be tempted to add more.\n\nGently squeeze and knead the dough, pressing it against the sides of the bowl, until it comes together in a shaggy ball with little-to-no dry patches (this can take up to 5 minutes). ② If absolutely necessary, and if after 5 minutes the dough still hasn’t come together, sprinkle a tiny amount of water on the most persistent dry patches.\n\nShape the dough into a disc, wrap it in cling film and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes or until it feels firm but not hard when you press down on it with your finger.\n\nRoll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to a 15 x 45cm rectangle. Turn the dough so that a short end is closest to you. Brush off any excess flour and fold the dough as you would an A4 letter - bottom third up towards the middle and the top third down over it.\nTurn the dough by 90 degrees (so that the open ends are closest and farthest from you). Roll out into a similar-sized rectangle and repeat the letter fold. For the best results, complete a total of 4-6 letter folds (the more you do, the greater the flakiness). If the dough becomes too soft at any point, chill it in the fridge for 15-30 minutes, then continue.\n\nWrap the dough in cling film and chill it for at least 30 minutes or until needed. (If you chill it for longer than 1 hour before using, soften it for about 15-30 minutes at room temperature, so that it’s pliable.)\n\nSTORAGE\n1 week in the fridge; 2-3 weeks in the freezer. Allow the pastry to thaw at room temperature for at least 1 hour before using - if you press down on it with a finger, you should leave an indentation (but it should feel fairly firm, not too soft to the touch)."

Dip each side of the bread into the custard, giving each side a few seconds in the mixture. Transfer the soaked bread immediately to the hot pan. Cook the toast until golden on each side, about 2-3 minutes per side.\nIn the meantime, prepare the caramelized pineapple. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter or coconut oil in a large saute pan. Coat each side of the pineapple slices in sugar, and immediately place in the hot butter. Cook the pineapple until starting to caramelize on one side, about 5 minutes. Stir and carefully flip the pineapple slices over, continue to cook for about another 4-5 minutes until the pineapple is softened and caramelized. Juice should release from the pineapple and mix with the caramel to form a lovely, golden caramel sauce.\nServe the toast warm and topped with the caramelized pineapple and some of the sauce. For additional serving ideas, you can also top with macadamia nuts, toasted coconut, whipped coconut cream, and/or maple or coconut syrup.\nNotes:\nTo make this recipe dairy-free, simply use coconut oil in place of butter. It will work fine as a 1:1 substitute.\nTo lighten-up this recipe, skip the caramelized part and top with fresh tropical fruit like mango, pineapple, and papaya.\nWant it extra coconut-y? Add in a splash of coconut extract or top with whipped coconut cream and plenty of toasted coconut."

Add enough fresh cold water to cover the beans by about 1 inch (2.5 cm), toss in the bay leaves, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer until the beans are just tender, which can take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the age of your beans. Add the salt and continue to cook for 15 minutes more.\nMeanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, sauté the bacon until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, move the bacon to a stack of paper towels placed on a plate.\nAdd the onion and pepper to the pan and cook in the bacon fat until the vegetables soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cumin, and oregano and cook, stirring, just until the garlic softens and the spice is fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Dump in the rice and stir constantly for a couple minutes to completely coat the rice with the bacon drippings. Then pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook until the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhen the beans are done, drain them, reserving at least 1/2 cup of the bean cooking liquid. Stir the beans into the pan containing the rice and continue cooking over medium-low heat until the rice is tender, 5 to 15 minutes more. If you need more liquid to fully cook the rice, use the reserved bean cooking liquid. Taste and adjust the seasoning to taste with salt. Stir in the bacon and serve the beans and rice immediately."

Wash the rhubarb stalks, cut into 1 inch lengths and while still slightly damp from washing combine in a small bowl with the 2tsp of extra caster sugar to coat and set aside.\nBeat the eggs and sugar using either a hand-held electric beater or a stand-up mixer for 5 minutes until very thick and pale in colour. Slowly beat in the soft butter, then beat for a further few minutes. A few small lumps of butter will remain, this is okay. Gently fold in the almond meal, rice flour, baking powder and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin. Dot the rhubarb pieces on top, gently pushing them down into the batter a little. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cake comes out clean and the rhubarb is tender.\nCool in the tin before serving dusted with icing sugar and softly whipped cream on the side."

In a small bowl, stir together glutinous rice flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In another small mixing bowl, stir together melted butter and brown sugar. Add in the egg and stir until the yolk has broken up and combined. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract. Add the dry mixture into the wet mixture and stir to combine until smooth. Spoon the batter (or use a piping bag) into the donut pan until almost full. Bake for 25-30 minutes until slightly browned on the edges. Stop at 25 minutes for softer donuts or 30 minutes for crisper donuts but be careful not to overbake otherwise they will be more hard than chewy. Let donuts cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes before lifting them out. Let cool completely on a wire rack before glazing.\nMATCHA WHITE CHOCOLATE GLAZE\nIn a small pot, bring about 1” of water to a boil. In a heat-safe bowl that fits perfectly on top of the pot without touching the water, add the chopped white chocolate, oil, and matcha powder. Turn off the heat and place the bowl on top of pot to create a double boiler. Let the chocolate sit undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes until it has mostly melted. Stir with a spatula to mix the matcha and chocolate together and ensure there are no unmelted chunks. Transfer the melted chocolate to a small bowl. Dip the donuts into the chocolate and shake off the excess. Place on a wire rack to set. Drizzle with any remaining white chocolate if desired.\nWHITE CHOCOLATE BISCOFF GLAZE\nUse the same directions as the matcha glaze above but without the matcha powder. Sprinkle the glazed donuts with crushed biscuits while they’re still wet.\nNOTES\nMelting white chocolate in microwave: Microwave in 10 second intervals, stirring in between each zap. Stop when it’s mostly melted. Be careful not to overheat it otherwise the chocolate will seize. If you’re making both glazes, save time by melting all of the white chocolate (200g) together and divide into two bowls. Stir matcha powder into one half."

Cook on low heat until the palm sugar dissolves, then increase heat. Let it start to boil, then qquickly remove from heat, and set aside. You can make this Pad Thai sauce ahead and put in a jar in the fridge up to a week.\n\nMethod for Pad Thai\n\nRinse the radish several times under cold water, gently squeezing off the water. Chop it and add a little bit of sugar to sweeten, mix well.\nSoak the rice stick noodle in warm water for about 15 minutes, leave in water until you are ready to use.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok at medium-high heat. Add egg and cook it quickly, scrambling into small pieces (see video below). Remove, set aside.\nAdd 2 tablespoons of oil in the same wok. Add shrimps and cook until done. Transfer to a bowl, set aside.\nAdd 1 tablespoon of oil to the wok. Add shallot, radish and tofu fry until aromatic. Increase the heat of your wok. Add a handful of soaked noodles followed with water. Stir-fry this mixture for about 5-6 minutes. The noodles will start to get soft. Add 1/4 cup of Pad Thai Sauce and mix well. Add sugar, cooked egg, bean sprout, chive and cooked shrimps. Stir well for another 1-2 minutes until everything blends together. Turn off heat, transfer to serving plate with sliced fresh lime, roasted peanuts, and more bean sprout on the side. Now dazzle your friends with the fact that your Pad Thai looks and tastes just as good as any restaurant. Enjoy!\nYou may add Thai chili powder, sugar and crushed peanuts at the table on the side."

    "text": "Instructions\nUsing frozen peas instead of pigeon peas:\n\nIncrease the water in the recipe by 1/2 cup so that you have 3 1/2 cups total.\nAfter you bring the water to a boil, add 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas and the rice.\nContinue the recipe as written!\n\nSteps:\n\nSoak the beans and bay leaf for 6-8 hours in 6-8 cups of water or broth; you want about 1 inch of liquid on top of the beans. I recommend soaking your beans for no more than 8 hours. You can soak at room temperature.\nAfter you soak the beans, bring beans to boil for 1-2 minutes, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer gently for 1-2 hours or until beans are tender and soft. The last half hour that your beans are cooking you can begin to make your sofrito (see below), or once the beans are done cooking you can turn the heat off and allow the beans to sit while you cook your sofrito. It’s just up to your advancement level of cooking and preference. REMOVE THE BAY LEAF BUT DO NOT DRAIN THE BEANS. The liquid is essential to the recipe!\nHow to make Sofrito (for 1 pound beans): Sofrito in spanish means sauce – very traditional in many of the main staple foods in Puerto Rico: Add oil to a medium skillet and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion, green pepper, cilantro and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and green peppers soften, about 3-5 minutes. Bring heat to low and add tomato sauce, sazon and simmer for 2-3 minutes until sauce comes together. Add your sofrito to the beans (remember you were not supposed to drain the beans) and simmer uncovered over medium low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, so that the spices infuse with the beans. After that, turn the bean off and cover so that they keep the heat while you finish making everything else. They should stay hot enough for an hour or so.\nWhile the beans are simmering with sofrito, start making the rice: Add oil to a medium pot and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion, green pepper, cilantro and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and green peppers soften, about 3-5 minutes. Bring heat to medium-low and add tomato sauce, sazon and adobo and simmer for 2 minutes until sauce comes together. Next add in entire can of pigeon peas (with the liquid – DO NOT DRAIN) and 3 cups water, and bring to a boil. Once it boils, stir in 2 cups of rice, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 20 minutes or until rice is tender.\nOnce beans and rice are done, taste both and adjust seasonings as necessary, including adding more salt.\n\nHow to serve: add rice and beans to a bowl with extra sauce from the beans, garnish with cilantro and a few avocado slices. You can also add hot sauce if you like a little heat. Serves 6."

If large cracks bigger than ¼-inch form around the edges—add more water (a teaspoon or two at a time).\n\n\nUse warm water: (or even hot water) It helps hydrate the flour better than cold water for less cracking and more tender homemade pupusa dough.\n\n\nUse damp hands: The masa dough is sticky, so dipping your hands in water (or oil) as needed will make it easier to shape and flatten without sticking to your hands.\n\n\nPinch off any excess: After filling and sealing the vegetarian pupusas, pinch away any excess dough and return it to the dough bowl, so they aren’t overly doughy.\n\n\nCook untouched: Don’t move the pupusas as they cook, so they can form a nice crust and avoid sticking.\n\nEat them with:\n\nMexican rice, regular rice, or other grains like quinoa\nHomemade ’slaw instead or curtido\nGuacamole\nSriracha or other hot sauce\nGrilled vegetable kebabs\nSweet potato fries\nA side salad\nFresh salsa (like Pico de Gallo or blended salsa)"

    "text": "Instructions\nPrepare the filling (can be done few days before and keep in the fridge): Preheat a skillet or wok. Add cooking oil and saute onion until they are soft and aromatic, about 3 minutes or so. Add chicken meat and the rest of the ingredients. If you use raw meat, continue to cook until the meat is cooked through. Have a taste. The filling should be savory and sweet. Adjust by adding more tamari/coconut aminos and/or brown sugar to your taste When you are happy with the taste. Mix the cornstarch with water and pour it into the skillet/wok to thicken the filling. Remove from the heat and let the filling cools down completely before wrapping or store in the fridge if not using it immediately\nActivate the yeast:\nPut all ingredients in the bowl and stir to mix. Let it sits for 10 minutes. The mixture should be foamy and bubbly, which indicates that the yeast is still active. If it doesn’t after 10 minutes, the yeast is no longer working and you need to get a new one before proceeding with the recipe Prepare the dough: Stir all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl to mix them up. Add the yeast mixture. Then gradually add the water/milk and oil and stir to roughly mix. Don’t add all the water/milk yet, start with about 80 ml of it and gradually add. This is important as different brand of flour may have slightly different liquid absorption capacity. Use one of your clean hands to knead it into a dough. The dough should feel a bit wet and moist but not sticky to your fingers. If the dough feels dry , cracking, and falls apart, add a bit more liquid, a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. It should feel like a “playdoh”. The dough doesn’t have any elasticity First proofing until doubles in size: Cover and put the dough in a warm place. I put mine in the oven and use the “bread proof” function. It took a bit over 1 hour for the dough to double in size. Don’t go by time. It may be faster or longer depending on the temperature\nShape and fill the dough:\nScoop the proofed dough out onto a working surface, lightly dusted with cornstarch. Use your clean hands to gather the dough back into one large dough and then divide into 8 equal portions. Keep them covered and work with one dough at a time Prepare a small cup of water next to you in case you need it to help you shape the dough. Roll the dough into a round ball and then use your thumb to gently press it in and then to the side to form a bowl (as shown in the photo and video). Put the filling inside the cavity. Gently mold the dough to seal the filling. If at any point the dough feels dry and crackly, dab the dough with a bit of water and then roll it into a smooth round ball. Place this on parchment paper and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.\nSecond proofing:\nPlace the shaped buns at a warm place again to let them proof until they are about 50% of their original size (they won’t double in size). This round will be faster, about15-30 minutes, but please don’t go by time. The dough needs to feel somewhat lighter when you lift them up and about 50% puffy\nSteaming:\nGet the steamer ready by bringing the water in the steamer to a rolling boil. Place the shaped buns inside a steaming basket or on a steaming rack. If you have a 3-tiered steamer, you can steam them all at once. Otherwise, you need to steam in batches. Lower the heat to medium and let the buns steamed for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, turn off the heat and wait for 1 minute before opening the lid Remove the steamed buns from the steamer and place them on a cooling rack. This is to prevent the bottom of the steamed buns from getting soggy from trapped condensation at the bottom\nServe:\nGluten-free steamed buns (or any steamed buns gluten-free or not) are best served warm. Gluten-free steamed buns will harden considerably when they have cooled down completely and after refrigeration. Simply reheat in a microwave or in the steamer and they will be as good as new There are many tips and other information about this gluten-free steamed bun recipe in the post that hopefully you find useful. So be sure to read them, they might answer some of the questions you have that is not covered in the recipe card"

When cool enough to handle, squeeze each garlic clove gently between your fingertips to release, discard the papery skins.\nIn the bottom of a large bowl, mash the roasted garlic cloves into a paste. Whisk in the vinegar, cream, and sugar until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oil until well blended.\nMAKE THE SUCCOTASH SALAD\nHeat a grill to medium-high.\nBrush the ears of corn with the oil. Grill, turning occasionally, until tender and charred in spots, about 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the cobs and add them to the bowl with the dressing. (If using frozen corn, simply boil it with the lima beans in the next step.)\n☞ TESTER TIP: To corral stray corn kernels as you cut them from the cob, place the ear of corn inside a deep, large bowl and use a sharp knife to trim downward, collecting the kernels in the bowl.\nFill a medium bowl with ice and water. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the lima beans to the boiling water and cook until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. (If using frozen corn, toss it in with the lima beans during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking.) Drain the beans, then transfer them to the ice water to cool. Drain again and add to the bowl with the dressing and corn. Add the bell peppers, onion, tomatoes, parsley, and mint to the bowl with the lima beans. Toss until evenly coated. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Cover the salad and chill for at least 30 minutes, or dump into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days before serving. (Editor’s note: This is one of those dishes that actually tastes better the longer it sits over the course of a day or two!)"
