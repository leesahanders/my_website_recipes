  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1⁄2 cup old-fashioned oats</li>
<li>2 Tbsp diced dried carrots / or same grated carrots (the more carrots the better)</li>
<li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>2 Tbsp raisins</li>
<li>2 Tbsp dry milk</li>
<li>1⁄4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>Pinch fine sea salt</li>
<li>2 Tbsp shredded coconut</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>At home:</p>
<p>(Optional - do this to make it more “cake” like, or keep as is for more of an oatmeal experience) Whirl the oats in a blender until about ⅓ of the original size.</p>
<p>Put them in a quart freezer bag. Process the carrots in the same manner, adding them to the bag along with the other dry ingredients.</p>
<p>In camp:</p>
<p>Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil in your pot. Add the dry ingredients, stirring well, and bring back to a boil. Remove the pot from the stove, cover tightly, and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir well and top with coconut.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>For a less strong carrot taste, only use 1 Tablespoon. Use coconut, rice, or soy milk powder for a vegan version. This recipe was featured in the Washington Trails Magazine, January/February 2011 issue.</p>

<p>At home I baked it for 15 min at 325 (the “reheat” setting) so the oats would cook a bit. This would be absolutely stellar camping.</p>

</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>2 large eggs, beaten</p>
<p>3/4 cup warm water or chicken broth</p>
<p>Kosher salt</p>
<p>2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</p>
<p>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</p>
<p>1 scallion, thinly sliced</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, water, and a pinch of salt and whisk until combined.</p>
<p>Set a sieve over a 3-cup heatproof serving bowl. Pour the egg mixture evenly through the sieve to remove air bubbles. Cover with an inverted heatproof plate.</p>
<p>Place a steamer or a steamer rack in a pot and fill the pot with water until it reaches just below the rack. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.</p>
<p>Reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently place the covered bowl in the steamer, cover the pot, and steam until solid yet still jiggly, about 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Carefully remove the bowl from the steamer. Garnish with soy sauce, sesame oil, and scallions. If desired, use a knife to cut through the surface of the curd in a cross-hatch design to allow the sauce to seep into the eggs.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups jasmine rice</li>
<li>1 14-ounce can full fat coconut milk about 2 cups plus 1/3 cup water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 red bell peppers, chopped</li>
<li>1 cucumber, chopped</li>
<li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
<li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
<li>1 cup roasted cashews</li>
<li>1/2 cup peanut butter</li>

<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rinse the rice well, until water no longer looks starchy. Drain well.</li>
<li>Open the can of coconut milk and scoop out the thick later of coconut cream, setting it aside. Pour the remaining coconut water in a large liquid measuring cup. Add enough water to the coconut water to measure 2 1/2 cups.</li>
<li>In a large pot, combine the coconut water and water mixture with the rice and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes. Stir once during that 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the reserved coconut cream. Transfer to a large bowl to cool.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, make the dressing. Combine peanut butter, water, lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar and sriracha in a medium bowl. Whisk well. You may need to add a little more water to thin if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
<li>Once the rice is cool, add the bell peppers, cucumber, carrots, green onions and cashews.</li>
<li>Serve drizzled with the peanut dressing.</li>

<p>Reserving 1/4 c from the can of melted coconut milk also worked, though I’m sure the method as written would be even better.</p>
<p>Add chicken (pan seared with soy sauce) to add some more protein if desired.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>Per person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ramen noodles 3 oz</li>
<li>Chicken packets (optional)</li>
<li>Peanuts 0.8 oz (optional, add craisins/raisins)</li>
<li>Peanut butter 1.3 oz</li>
<li>Toasted sesame oil 0.2 oz</li>
<li>Soy sauce 0.2 oz</li>
<li>Coconut milk powder 0.1 oz</li>
<li>Garlic 0.1 oz</li>
<li>Ginger powder (1/8 tsp)</li>
<li>Siracha 0.03 oz</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grelim-Gluten-Free-Squeezed-Beverages-Smoothies/dp/B0BY8ZNV4L/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2886HENCPMRR9&amp;keywords=dehydrated%2Blime%2Bpowder&amp;qid=1693600008&amp;sprefix=dehydrated%2Blime%2Bpowde%2Caps%2C134&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1">Lime (dehydrated)</a> 0.02 oz</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>At home:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sauce should be made at home. Mix all of the sauce ingredients.</li>
<li>If you prefer smaller noodle pieces to long, stringy ones, crush the noodles before opening the package. But be careful — the package can rip open.</li>
<li>Discard the “flavor” packet, which isn’t necessary and might over-salt the meal.</li>
<li>Andrew recommends using a 4 or 8 oz nalgene wide mouth, but we used human gear small tubs and it worked great.</li>
</ul>
<p>At camp:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the peanut sauce at any time.</li>
<li>Bring to a boil at least 8 oz of water.</li>
<li>Add the Ramen and the toppings (crushed nuts, craisins, red peppers), turn off the stove or let it burn out. Beware of boil-over. Allow the noodles sit for 5 minutes before enjoying.</li>
<li>Remove and reserve some water if needed</li>
<li>To get the sauce out of the bottle, we add water and shake vigorously. A 32-ounce bottle becomes very clean after two or three rounds.</li>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong> Food Steamer Electric food steamer Bamboo Steamer Small Round Parchment Paper</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>To activate the yeast:</p>
<p>5 gr instant yeast 1 tsp sugar 2 Tbsp warm water (not hot)</p>
<p>Dry ingredients for the dough (I highly recommend using a measuring scale):</p>
<p>88 gr cornstarch plus more for dusting as needed. See notes 43 gr potato starch 45 gr glutinous rice flour 50 gr rice flour 1 tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt 30 gr sugar</p>
<p>Wet ingredients for the dough:</p>
<p>80 ml water or dairy/non-dairy milk start with this amount. I used about 130 ml 30 ml cooking oil</p>
<p>For the gluten-free meat filling (you can use whatever filling you like):</p>
<p>1 Tbsp cooking oil 1 large onion peeled and finely chopped 120 gr leftover chicken meat (diced or shredded) (4.2 oz) or you can use about 200 grams (7 oz) raw chicken or pork 1 Tbsp tamari or coconut aminos. More or less to your taste 2 Tbsp brown sugar or more to your taste 1 tsp sesame oil ¼ tsp ground black pepper</p>
<p>To thicken the filling:</p>
<p>2 tsp cornstarch 1 Tbsp water</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Prepare the filling (can be done few days before and keep in the fridge): Preheat a skillet or wok. Add cooking oil and saute onion until they are soft and aromatic, about 3 minutes or so. Add chicken meat and the rest of the ingredients. If you use raw meat, continue to cook until the meat is cooked through. Have a taste. The filling should be savory and sweet. Adjust by adding more tamari/coconut aminos and/or brown sugar to your taste When you are happy with the taste. Mix the cornstarch with water and pour it into the skillet/wok to thicken the filling. Remove from the heat and let the filling cools down completely before wrapping or store in the fridge if not using it immediately</p>
<p>Activate the yeast:</p>
<p>Put all ingredients in the bowl and stir to mix. Let it sits for 10 minutes. The mixture should be foamy and bubbly, which indicates that the yeast is still active. If it doesn’t after 10 minutes, the yeast is no longer working and you need to get a new one before proceeding with the recipe Prepare the dough: Stir all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl to mix them up. Add the yeast mixture. Then gradually add the water/milk and oil and stir to roughly mix. Don’t add all the water/milk yet, start with about 80 ml of it and gradually add. This is important as different brand of flour may have slightly different liquid absorption capacity. Use one of your clean hands to knead it into a dough. The dough should feel a bit wet and moist but not sticky to your fingers. If the dough feels dry , cracking, and falls apart, add a bit more liquid, a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. It should feel like a “playdoh”. The dough doesn’t have any elasticity First proofing until doubles in size: Cover and put the dough in a warm place. I put mine in the oven and use the “bread proof” function. It took a bit over 1 hour for the dough to double in size. Don’t go by time. It may be faster or longer depending on the temperature</p>
<p>Shape and fill the dough:</p>
<p>Scoop the proofed dough out onto a working surface, lightly dusted with cornstarch. Use your clean hands to gather the dough back into one large dough and then divide into 8 equal portions. Keep them covered and work with one dough at a time Prepare a small cup of water next to you in case you need it to help you shape the dough. Roll the dough into a round ball and then use your thumb to gently press it in and then to the side to form a bowl (as shown in the photo and video). Put the filling inside the cavity. Gently mold the dough to seal the filling. If at any point the dough feels dry and crackly, dab the dough with a bit of water and then roll it into a smooth round ball. Place this on parchment paper and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.</p>
<p>Second proofing:</p>
<p>Place the shaped buns at a warm place again to let them proof until they are about 50% of their original size (they won’t double in size). This round will be faster, about15-30 minutes, but please don’t go by time. The dough needs to feel somewhat lighter when you lift them up and about 50% puffy</p>
<p>Steaming:</p>
<p>Get the steamer ready by bringing the water in the steamer to a rolling boil. Place the shaped buns inside a steaming basket or on a steaming rack. If you have a 3-tiered steamer, you can steam them all at once. Otherwise, you need to steam in batches. Lower the heat to medium and let the buns steamed for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, turn off the heat and wait for 1 minute before opening the lid Remove the steamed buns from the steamer and place them on a cooling rack. This is to prevent the bottom of the steamed buns from getting soggy from trapped condensation at the bottom</p>
<p>Serve:</p>
<p>Gluten-free steamed buns (or any steamed buns gluten-free or not) are best served warm. Gluten-free steamed buns will harden considerably when they have cooled down completely and after refrigeration. Simply reheat in a microwave or in the steamer and they will be as good as new There are many tips and other information about this gluten-free steamed bun recipe in the post that hopefully you find useful. So be sure to read them, they might answer some of the questions you have that is not covered in the recipe card</p>

<p>Yield: 4 servings</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3⁄4 cup roasted and shelled peanuts</li>
<li>2 tablespoons peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn</li>
<li>1 medium red or white onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
<li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
<li>1⁄2 pound skinless, boneless chicken (about 2 thighs or breasts) cut into chunks</li>
<li>Pinch of cayenne</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>6 cups stock or water</li>
<li>2 sweet potatoes or yams (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into thick slices</li>
<li>8 plum tomatoes, cored and halved (canned are supposedly fine; drain and reserve liquid for another use, but Lisa strongly recommends actual tomatoes)</li>
<li>1⁄2 pound collards or kale, washedand cut into wide ribbons</li>
<li>1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup peanut butter, chunky or smooth</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Step 1 Chop peanuts, or crush them with the side of a knife, or pulse them in a food processor to chop roughly.</p>
<p>Step 2 Put oil in a deep skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat; a minute later, add onion, ginger and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken and continue cooking for another 3 or 4 minutes, until just coloring. Add 1⁄2 cup peanuts and the cayenne and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Step 3 Stir in the stock and the sweet potatoes, bring to a boil, and turn heat down to medium-low so the soup bubbles gently. Stir in tomatoes and collards, then cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 4 Stir in 1⁄4 cup peanut butter. Taste, adjust seasoning (you may want to add more peanut butter at this point) and serve, garnished with remaining peanuts.</p>
</section>
<section id="lisas-notes" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="lisas-notes">Lisa’s notes</h2>
<p>Use real tomatoes, not canned</p>
<p>1/8th teaspoon cayenne</p>
<p>Double the recipe</p>
<p>Reduce the liquid (8 c stock seems right)</p>
<p>Cook chard on side with garlic</p>

  <title>Black Bean Soup with Dumplings (Orejitas)</title>
  <dc:creator>Rancho Gordo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/Black bean soup with dumplings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>I recommend doubling this. Claims this makes 4 servings, but when hungry having a double batch goes a longer way (and uses the full bag of Rancho Gordo black beans).</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups masa</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lard (can be substituted with olive oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>1/4 of an onion, sliced</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, cut into halves or thirds</li>
<li>3 cups cooked Rancho Gordo Chiapas Black beans or other black beans</li>
<li>4 cups bean broth from the Chiapas beans</li>
<li>3 sprigs fresh epazote</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a mixing bowl, add 1 cup of masa and mix in ½ cup of water, 1 tablespoon of lard or oil, and ⅛ teaspoon of salt. Knead the masa into a ball to ensure the ingredients are well-mixed. The masa will be ready when there is no visible flour and it holds together without falling apart. This will be used to make the orejitas (masa balls).</li>
<li>To make the orejitas, use the masa to make small balls, about the size of ping-pong balls, and make a dent in the center with your thumb.</li>
<li>In a medium saucepan, boil 2½ cups of water. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and add the orejitas; let them cook for 10 minutes. Once the 10 minutes is over, leave the orejitas in the pot. You will use them later on.</li>
<li>In a blender, combine ½ cup of masa with 1½ cups of water and blend until there is no masa visible. Set aside; this will be used in the beans.</li>
<li>In a soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon of lard or oil over medium-low heat. Add the sliced onion and garlic; saute until golden brown. Add the 3 springs of epazote, the beans, and the 4 cups of broth. Using a strainer, pass the masa-water mixture from the blender into the pot of beans, removing any lumps that may have formed. The color of the broth will become a bit lighter. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, then add the masa orejitas. Bring the pot to a simmer, and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings, then serve.</li>
</ul>

<h2 data-anchor-id="lisas-notes">Lisa’s notes</h2>
<p>Substituted parsley and added at the end as garnish, very yummy. Next time boil the dumplings in the bean soup water, no need to dirty an additional pan.</p>
<p>Pressure cook the beans for 16-17 min. (14 was still a bit crunchy)</p>

When the oil is hot, add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook until the skin is deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, skin side up, cover, and set aside. Pour off all except for 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the heat to medium and add the leeks and garlic to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the leeks begin to soften and turn golden, 3 to 6 minutes. Add the white wine and cook until the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the wild rice blend, thyme, and chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the jasmine rice, raisins, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and 1½ cups of water to the skillet, and bring the mixture back to a boil. Return the thighs to the skillet, skin side up, cover the skillet, and transfer it to the oven. Cook until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is almost tender, about 25 minutes. Then remove the lid and cook for another 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges and dollops of sour cream.</p></li>

<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Using frozen peas instead of pigeon peas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the water in the recipe by 1/2 cup so that you have 3 1/2 cups total.</li>
<li>After you bring the water to a boil, add 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas and the rice.</li>
<li>Continue the recipe as written!</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Soak the beans and bay leaf for 6-8 hours in 6-8 cups of water or broth; you want about 1 inch of liquid on top of the beans. I recommend soaking your beans for no more than 8 hours. You can soak at room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>After you soak the beans, bring beans to boil for 1-2 minutes, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer gently for 1-2 hours or until beans are tender and soft. The last half hour that your beans are cooking you can begin to make your sofrito (see below), or once the beans are done cooking you can turn the heat off and allow the beans to sit while you cook your sofrito. It’s just up to your advancement level of cooking and preference. REMOVE THE BAY LEAF BUT DO NOT DRAIN THE BEANS. The liquid is essential to the recipe!</p></li>
<li><p>How to make Sofrito (for 1 pound beans): Sofrito in spanish means sauce – very traditional in many of the main staple foods in Puerto Rico: Add oil to a medium skillet and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion, green pepper, cilantro and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and green peppers soften, about 3-5 minutes. Bring heat to low and add tomato sauce, sazon and simmer for 2-3 minutes until sauce comes together. Add your sofrito to the beans (remember you were not supposed to drain the beans) and simmer uncovered over medium low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, so that the spices infuse with the beans. After that, turn the bean off and cover so that they keep the heat while you finish making everything else. They should stay hot enough for an hour or so.</p></li>
<li><p>While the beans are simmering with sofrito, start making the rice: Add oil to a medium pot and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion, green pepper, cilantro and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and green peppers soften, about 3-5 minutes. Bring heat to medium-low and add tomato sauce, sazon and adobo and simmer for 2 minutes until sauce comes together. Next add in entire can of pigeon peas (with the liquid – DO NOT DRAIN) and 3 cups water, and bring to a boil. Once it boils, stir in 2 cups of rice, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 20 minutes or until rice is tender.</p></li>
<li><p>Once beans and rice are done, taste both and adjust seasonings as necessary, including adding more salt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How to serve: add rice and beans to a bowl with extra sauce from the beans, garnish with cilantro and a few avocado slices. You can also add hot sauce if you like a little heat. Serves 6.</p>
