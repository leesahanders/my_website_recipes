<p>Yield: 4 servings</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>3⁄4 cup roasted and shelled peanuts 2 tablespoons peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn 1 medium red or white onion, chopped 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1⁄2 pound skinless, boneless chicken (about 2 thighs or breasts) cut into chunks Pinch of cayenne Salt freshly ground black pepper 6 cups stock or water 2 sweet potatoes or yams (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into thick slices 8 plum tomatoes, cored and halved (canned are fine; drain and reserve liquid for another use) 1⁄2 pound collards or kale, washed and cut into wide ribbons 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup peanut butter, chunky or smooth</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Step 1 Chop peanuts, or crush them with the side of a knife, or pulse them in a food processor to chop roughly.</p>
<p>Step 2 Put oil in a deep skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat; a minute later, add onion, ginger and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken and continue cooking for another 3 or 4 minutes, until just coloring. Add 1⁄2 cup peanuts and the cayenne and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Step 3 Stir in the stock and the sweet potatoes, bring to a boil, and turn heat down to medium-low so the soup bubbles gently. Stir in tomatoes and collards, then cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 4 Stir in 1⁄4 cup peanut butter. Taste, adjust seasoning (you may want to add more peanut butter at this point) and serve, garnished with remaining peanuts.</p>

<p>Use real tomatoes, not canned</p>
<p>1/8th teaspoon cayenne</p>
<p>Double the recipe</p>
<p>Reduce the liquid (8 c stock seems right)</p>
<p>Cook chard on side with garlic</p>

  <title>Black Bean Soup with Dumplings (Orejitas)</title>
  <dc:creator>Rancho Gordo</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/Black bean soup with dumplings.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>I recommend doubling this. Claims this makes 4 servings, but when hungry having a double batch goes a longer way (and uses the full bag of Rancho Gordo black beans).</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups masa</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lard (can be substituted with olive oil)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>1/4 of an onion, sliced</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, cut into halves or thirds</li>
<li>3 cups cooked Rancho Gordo Chiapas Black beans or other black beans</li>
<li>4 cups bean broth from the Chiapas beans</li>
<li>3 sprigs fresh epazote</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a mixing bowl, add 1 cup of masa and mix in ½ cup of water, 1 tablespoon of lard or oil, and ⅛ teaspoon of salt. Knead the masa into a ball to ensure the ingredients are well-mixed. The masa will be ready when there is no visible flour and it holds together without falling apart. This will be used to make the orejitas (masa balls).</li>
<li>To make the orejitas, use the masa to make small balls, about the size of ping-pong balls, and make a dent in the center with your thumb.</li>
<li>In a medium saucepan, boil 2½ cups of water. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and add the orejitas; let them cook for 10 minutes. Once the 10 minutes is over, leave the orejitas in the pot. You will use them later on.</li>
<li>In a blender, combine ½ cup of masa with 1½ cups of water and blend until there is no masa visible. Set aside; this will be used in the beans.</li>
<li>In a soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon of lard or oil over medium-low heat. Add the sliced onion and garlic; saute until golden brown. Add the 3 springs of epazote, the beans, and the 4 cups of broth. Using a strainer, pass the masa-water mixture from the blender into the pot of beans, removing any lumps that may have formed. The color of the broth will become a bit lighter. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, then add the masa orejitas. Bring the pot to a simmer, and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings, then serve.</li>
</ul>

<p>Substituted parsley and added at the end as garnish, very yummy. Next time boil the dumplings in the bean soup water, no need to dirty an additional pan.</p>
<p>Pressure cook the beans for 16-17 min. (14 was still a bit crunchy)</p>

<p>SERVES 4 TO 6</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each)</p>
<p>4 small leeks, light green and white parts thinly sliced (see How to Clean Leeks, opposite)</p>
<p>6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</p>
<p>1½ cup dry white wine</p>
<p>3/4 cup wild rice blend</p>
<p>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves</p>
<p>13½ cups chicken broth (page 20)</p>
<p>3¼ cup jasmine rice</p>
<p>1½ cup chopped golden raisins</p>
<p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>Lemon wedges, for serving</p>
<p>Sour cream, for serving</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In a 12-inch straight-sided oven-safe skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook until the skin is deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, skin side up, cover, and set aside. Pour off all except for 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the heat to medium and add the leeks and garlic to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the leeks begin to soften and turn golden, 3 to 6 minutes. Add the white wine and cook until the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the wild rice blend, thyme, and chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the jasmine rice, raisins, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and 1½ cups of water to the skillet, and bring the mixture back to a boil. Return the thighs to the skillet, skin side up, cover the skillet, and transfer it to the oven. Cook until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is almost tender, about 25 minutes. Then remove the lid and cook for another 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges and dollops of sour cream.</p></li>

<li>1/2 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
</ul>
<p>For the beans:</p>

<li>6-8 cups water or vegetarian broth</li>
<li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sofrito (for the beans):</p>
<ul>
<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
<li>½ cup finely diced yellow onion</li>
<li>½ cup finely diced green bell pepper</li>
<li>¼ cup finely diced cilantro</li>

</ul>
<p>For the rice:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup finely diced yellow onion</li>
<li>1/3 cup finely diced green bell pepper</li>
<li>¼ cup finely diced cilantro</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>½ cup no salt added tomato sauce</li>
<li>3 teaspoons (2 packets) Sazon Culantro ey Achiote* (see note in recipe for how to make your own)</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon adobo (or just a pinch)</li>
<li>1 (15 oz) can Goya Green Pigeon peas** (see note in recipe for a sub)</li>
<li>3 cups water</li>
<li>2 cups basmati white rice</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Using frozen peas instead of pigeon peas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the water in the recipe by 1/2 cup so that you have 3 1/2 cups total.</li>
<li>After you bring the water to a boil, add 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas and the rice.</li>
<li>Continue the recipe as written!</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Soak the beans and bay leaf for 6-8 hours in 6-8 cups of water or broth; you want about 1 inch of liquid on top of the beans. I recommend soaking your beans for no more than 8 hours. You can soak at room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>After you soak the beans, bring beans to boil for 1-2 minutes, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer gently for 1-2 hours or until beans are tender and soft. The last half hour that your beans are cooking you can begin to make your sofrito (see below), or once the beans are done cooking you can turn the heat off and allow the beans to sit while you cook your sofrito. It’s just up to your advancement level of cooking and preference. REMOVE THE BAY LEAF BUT DO NOT DRAIN THE BEANS. The liquid is essential to the recipe!</p></li>
<li><p>How to make Sofrito (for 1 pound beans): Sofrito in spanish means sauce – very traditional in many of the main staple foods in Puerto Rico: Add oil to a medium skillet and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion, green pepper, cilantro and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and green peppers soften, about 3-5 minutes. Bring heat to low and add tomato sauce, sazon and simmer for 2-3 minutes until sauce comes together. Add your sofrito to the beans (remember you were not supposed to drain the beans) and simmer uncovered over medium low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, so that the spices infuse with the beans. After that, turn the bean off and cover so that they keep the heat while you finish making everything else. They should stay hot enough for an hour or so.</p></li>
<li><p>While the beans are simmering with sofrito, start making the rice: Add oil to a medium pot and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion, green pepper, cilantro and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and green peppers soften, about 3-5 minutes. Bring heat to medium-low and add tomato sauce, sazon and adobo and simmer for 2 minutes until sauce comes together. Next add in entire can of pigeon peas (with the liquid – DO NOT DRAIN) and 3 cups water, and bring to a boil. Once it boils, stir in 2 cups of rice, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 20 minutes or until rice is tender.</p></li>
<li><p>Once beans and rice are done, taste both and adjust seasonings as necessary, including adding more salt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How to serve: add rice and beans to a bowl with extra sauce from the beans, garnish with cilantro and a few avocado slices. You can also add hot sauce if you like a little heat. Serves 6.</p>

  <title>Chicken Pot Pie</title>
  <dc:creator>America&#39;s Test Kitchen and Baked to Perfection</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="pie-crust---from-baked-to-perfection-flaky-all-butter-pie-crust" class="level1">
<h1>Pie crust - from Baked to Perfection “FLAKY ALL-BUTTER PIE CRUST”</h1>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>375g gluten-free flour blend</p>
<p>2 tablespoons caster sugar (for sweet pastry) or 1 teaspoon caster sugar (for savoury)</p>
<p>1½ teaspoons xanthan gum</p>
<p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p>250g unsalted butter, cut into 1cm cubes, chilled</p>
<p>150g cold water</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>MAKES 1 quantity</p>
<p>PREP TIME 45 mins</p>
<p>CHILL TIME 1 hour</p>
<p>While most wheat-based pie-crust recipes follow the 3-2-1 rule for the flour:butter:water ratio, a gluten-free version needs a 3-2-slightly-more-than-1 rule owing to the greater water- absorption capacity of gluten-free flours. The best ratio for the gluten-free flour blends in this book (see page 19) is 3:2:1.2 - but it might be different for other blend compositions.</p>
<p>Because you leave the butter pieces relatively large, the dough is initially (quite unsuccessfully) kept together only by the added water, which is why it will look incredibly dry and crumbly. As you knead, however, small portions of the butter melt from the heat of your hands, helping the dough to come together.</p>
<p>The secret to making perfectly flaky, buttery pie crust lies in keeping the butter pieces large and in several rounds of folding to create a rudimentary form of lamination. This, in turn, makes the dough easier to handle and the baked crust extra flaky. When making the pie crust, you may be tempted to add more water. Resist: adding more water will just make the crust tough. Instead, keep kneading and see the pastry transform into a beautiful dough (see Note #2). This recipe makes enough for a 23cm pie with both a base and a full pastry lid.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a large bowl, mix together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, xanthan gum and salt.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the cold butter and toss it in the flour until each piece is coated.</p></li>
<li><p>Squish each cube of butter between your fingers to form small, thin sheets of butter. Be sure to check you’ve squished all the butter pieces before adding the water.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the cold water and mix well with a fork or spatula until the dough starts coming together. After you’ve added all the water, the dough will still look very dry - don’t be tempted to add more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Gently squeeze and knead the dough, pressing it against the sides of the bowl, until it comes together in a shaggy ball with little-to-no dry patches (this can take up to 5 minutes). ② If absolutely necessary, and if after 5 minutes the dough still hasn’t come together, sprinkle a tiny amount of water on the most persistent dry patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape the dough into a disc, wrap it in cling film and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes or until it feels firm but not hard when you press down on it with your finger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to a 15 x 45cm rectangle. Turn the dough so that a short end is closest to you. Brush off any excess flour and fold the dough as you would an A4 letter - bottom third up towards the middle and the top third down over it.</p>
<p>Turn the dough by 90 degrees (so that the open ends are closest and farthest from you). Roll out into a similar-sized rectangle and repeat the letter fold. For the best results, complete a total of 4-6 letter folds (the more you do, the greater the flakiness). If the dough becomes too soft at any point, chill it in the fridge for 15-30 minutes, then continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrap the dough in cling film and chill it for at least 30 minutes or until needed. (If you chill it for longer than 1 hour before using, soften it for about 15-30 minutes at room temperature, so that it’s pliable.)</li>
</ul>
<p>STORAGE</p>
<p>1 week in the fridge; 2-3 weeks in the freezer. Allow the pastry to thaw at room temperature for at least 1 hour before using - if you press down on it with a finger, you should leave an indentation (but it should feel fairly firm, not too soft to the touch).</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>1 1/4 cups small brown or green lentils, rinsed</p>
<p>1 quart (4 cups) cold water or homemade chicken stock or canned chicken broth</p>
<p>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p>1 medium onion, finely chopped</p>
<p>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</p>
<p>2 tablespoons (1 oz) unsalted butter</p>
<p>4 ounces small cremini mushrooms, halved or quartered if large</p>
<p>4 ounces oyster or other mushrooms, cut into pieces</p>
<p>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>3 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped, plus more for garnish</p>
<p>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste</p>
<p>6 to 12 slices bacon*, preferably thick-cut</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Place the lentils in a large saucepan, cover with the water or stock, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer gently until tender, at least 35 minutes or so. (The exact timing will depend on the type and age of the lentils.) Drain well.</p>
<p>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet over medium heat, add the onion and sauté just until softened and pale golden, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the butter, the remaining oil, and the mushrooms, and sauté until the mushrooms are tender. Season with salt and pepper. Add the lentils, the 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and heat, stirring, just until warmed through. Remove and discard the garlic. Taste and season the lentils accordingly with more lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Meanwhile, in a separate skillet, fry the bacon until crisp.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the lentils with extra parsley and bacon, left whole or crumbled into pieces, the more the better.</p>

<p>Just crimini mushrooms was delicious. Very forgiving. Try cooking the bacon first and using that instead of butter (or in addition to).</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>1 medium (6 1/2 oz) onion, cut into small dice</p>
<p>2 large garlic cloves, minced</p>
<p>8 ounces store-bought or homemade fresh chorizo sausage, casings removed</p>
<p>One (14-ounce) sweet potato, peeled and diced</p>
<p>4 cups store-bought canned chicken broth or homemade chicken stock</p>

<p>Serves: ⅔ cup (about 4 servings)</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>2 tablespoons dairy-free buttery spread</p>
<p>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (can sub wheat flour for “tan” sauce; use sweet white rice flour for gluten free)</p>
<p>½ cup unsweetened dairy-free half &amp; half (I used Ripple Original)</p>
<p>½ cup water, plus additional as needed</p>
<p>¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste</p>
<p>Black or white pepper, to taste (optional)</p>
<p>Pinch nutmeg (optional)</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Melt the buttery spread in a small saucepan over medium heat.</p>
<p>Whisk in the flour until smooth and bubbly.</p>
<p>Gradually add the half &amp; half, while whisking, until smooth.</p>
<p>Gradually add the water, while whisking, until smooth.</p>
<p>Whisk and cook until thickened to your desired consistency. If it thickens too much, whisk in a little more water. Season with the salt and pepper or nutmeg (if using).</p>
<p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat and whisk until smooth before using. Add more water, if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Super-Creamy Option:</strong> Reduce the buttery spread and flour to 1 tablespoon each. Increase the dairy-free half &amp; half to 1 cup and omit the water. This very thick sauce can be seasoned and used in layered dishes, or stirred into another sauce, soup, pasta, or rice dish.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong> Food Steamer Electric food steamer Bamboo Steamer Small Round Parchment Paper</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>To activate the yeast:</p>
<p>5 gr instant yeast 1 tsp sugar 2 Tbsp warm water (not hot)</p>
<p>Dry ingredients for the dough (I highly recommend using a measuring scale):</p>
<p>88 gr cornstarch plus more for dusting as needed. See notes 43 gr potato starch 45 gr glutinous rice flour 50 gr rice flour 1 tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt 30 gr sugar</p>
<p>Wet ingredients for the dough:</p>
<p>80 ml water or dairy/non-dairy milk start with this amount. I used about 130 ml 30 ml cooking oil</p>
<p>For the gluten-free meat filling (you can use whatever filling you like):</p>
<p>1 Tbsp cooking oil 1 large onion peeled and finely chopped 120 gr leftover chicken meat (diced or shredded) (4.2 oz) or you can use about 200 grams (7 oz) raw chicken or pork 1 Tbsp tamari or coconut aminos. More or less to your taste 2 Tbsp brown sugar or more to your taste 1 tsp sesame oil ¼ tsp ground black pepper</p>
<p>To thicken the filling:</p>
<p>2 tsp cornstarch 1 Tbsp water</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Prepare the filling (can be done few days before and keep in the fridge): Preheat a skillet or wok. Add cooking oil and saute onion until they are soft and aromatic, about 3 minutes or so. Add chicken meat and the rest of the ingredients. If you use raw meat, continue to cook until the meat is cooked through. Have a taste. The filling should be savory and sweet. Adjust by adding more tamari/coconut aminos and/or brown sugar to your taste When you are happy with the taste. Mix the cornstarch with water and pour it into the skillet/wok to thicken the filling. Remove from the heat and let the filling cools down completely before wrapping or store in the fridge if not using it immediately</p>
<p>Activate the yeast:</p>
<p>Put all ingredients in the bowl and stir to mix. Let it sits for 10 minutes. The mixture should be foamy and bubbly, which indicates that the yeast is still active. If it doesn’t after 10 minutes, the yeast is no longer working and you need to get a new one before proceeding with the recipe Prepare the dough: Stir all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl to mix them up. Add the yeast mixture. Then gradually add the water/milk and oil and stir to roughly mix. Don’t add all the water/milk yet, start with about 80 ml of it and gradually add. This is important as different brand of flour may have slightly different liquid absorption capacity. Use one of your clean hands to knead it into a dough. The dough should feel a bit wet and moist but not sticky to your fingers. If the dough feels dry , cracking, and falls apart, add a bit more liquid, a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. It should feel like a “playdoh”. The dough doesn’t have any elasticity First proofing until doubles in size: Cover and put the dough in a warm place. I put mine in the oven and use the “bread proof” function. It took a bit over 1 hour for the dough to double in size. Don’t go by time. It may be faster or longer depending on the temperature</p>
<p>Shape and fill the dough:</p>
<p>Scoop the proofed dough out onto a working surface, lightly dusted with cornstarch. Use your clean hands to gather the dough back into one large dough and then divide into 8 equal portions. Keep them covered and work with one dough at a time Prepare a small cup of water next to you in case you need it to help you shape the dough. Roll the dough into a round ball and then use your thumb to gently press it in and then to the side to form a bowl (as shown in the photo and video). Put the filling inside the cavity. Gently mold the dough to seal the filling. If at any point the dough feels dry and crackly, dab the dough with a bit of water and then roll it into a smooth round ball. Place this on parchment paper and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.</p>
<p>Second proofing:</p>
<p>Place the shaped buns at a warm place again to let them proof until they are about 50% of their original size (they won’t double in size). This round will be faster, about15-30 minutes, but please don’t go by time. The dough needs to feel somewhat lighter when you lift them up and about 50% puffy</p>
<p>Steaming:</p>
<p>Get the steamer ready by bringing the water in the steamer to a rolling boil. Place the shaped buns inside a steaming basket or on a steaming rack. If you have a 3-tiered steamer, you can steam them all at once. Otherwise, you need to steam in batches. Lower the heat to medium and let the buns steamed for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, turn off the heat and wait for 1 minute before opening the lid Remove the steamed buns from the steamer and place them on a cooling rack. This is to prevent the bottom of the steamed buns from getting soggy from trapped condensation at the bottom</p>
<p>Serve:</p>
<p>Gluten-free steamed buns (or any steamed buns gluten-free or not) are best served warm. Gluten-free steamed buns will harden considerably when they have cooled down completely and after refrigeration. Simply reheat in a microwave or in the steamer and they will be as good as new There are many tips and other information about this gluten-free steamed bun recipe in the post that hopefully you find useful. So be sure to read them, they might answer some of the questions you have that is not covered in the recipe card</p>

  <title>Butternut Squash soup with Sage and Sausage</title>

<p>Butternut squash soup is perfect for fall, but it tastes great all year long. Sausage pairs nicely with the lightly sweet and creamy soup, and fried sage adds an herby crunch. The baking soda helps the squash magically brown in the pot, giving the soup a stronger flavor.</p>
<p>PREP: 12 MINUTES PRESSURE: 15 MINUTES TOTAL: 35 MINUTES</p>

<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p>8 fresh sage leaves</p>
<p>10 ounces uncooked Italian- style pork or chicken sausage, without casing</p>
<p>½ 2 small celery stalks, chopped 2 large garlic cloves, smashed 1 medium butternut squash,</p>
<p>large yellow onion, chopped</p>
<p>peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 4 cups)</p>
<p>2 cups chicken or vegetable broth, plus more as needed</p>
<p>½ teaspoon baking soda Kosher salt</p>
<p>Freshly ground black pepper ½ cup heavy cream or half- and-half (optional) Pinch ground nutmeg</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To preheat the Instant Pot, select Sauté on high. Once hot, add the oil followed by the sage leaves. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes until crispy. Remove and drain on a paper towel.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the sausage. Use a spoon or spatula to break up the sausage into small pieces as it cooks. Continue until the sausage is cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a plate.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the onion to the pot and cook for 1 minute. Add the celery and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and lightly browned.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the squash, broth, and baking soda and stir. Season with salt and pepper. Secure the lid.</p></li>
<li><p>Select Manual and cook at high pressure for 15 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Once cooking is complete, use a quick release.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the cream (if using) and nutmeg, and purée with an immersion blender. Alternatively, blend in batches in a blender with the lid slightly cracked. Add more broth or cream if you want a thinner soup. Taste for seasoning. Serve in bowls topped with crispy sage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>SUBSTITUTION TIP: To make this dish Paleo, leave out the cream and substitute with more broth.</p>
