<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>1 ½ lbs. bacon 2 sweet yellow onions sliced into thin ribbons ½ cup + 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar ½ cup brown sugar 2 tsp kosher salt 1 tsp black pepper</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lay the bacon slices out in a single layer on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake for 14 minutes, or until the bacon is nice and crispy. Lay out on paper towels to drain and set aside, reserving 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease.</p>
<p>Add the bacon grease to a large skillet and heat over medium, medium low heat, then add the onions and stir around to coat with the bacon grease. Allow to slowly cook for an hour, checking every ten minutes or so to stir and scrape up any black bits that form on the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>Once the onions are a dark golden brown color, deglaze the pan with the 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, scraping the pan as the vinegar dissolves. Add the remaining balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, salt, and pepper and stir until a thick glaze forms, around 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the onion mixture and bacon to a food processor and pulse until the desired consistency forms. Scoop the bacon jam into a jar and devour immediately, or refrigerate until future use. Use within one week.</p>

  <title>Butter Chicken</title>
  <dc:creator>Two Sleevers</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/butter chicken.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>INGREDIENTS</p>
<p>1 14- ounce Canned Tomatoes 5-6 cloves Garlic 1-2 teaspoons Minced Ginger 1 teaspoon Turmeric 1/2 teaspoons Cayenne Pepper 1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt 1 teaspoon Garam Masala 1 teaspoon Ground Cumin 1 pound Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs (or use breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time) To finish 4 ounces butter cut into cubes (use coconut oil if dairy free) 4 ounces Heavy Cream (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy free) 1 teaspoon Garam Masala 1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>INSTANT POT INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it’s frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated. It’s best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don’t shred it. Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles</p>

<p>CHILL TIME 30MINUTES</p>
<p>TOTAL TIME 1HOUR HOUR 30MINUTES MINUTES</p>
</section>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>FOR THE DRESSING</p>
<p>4 large garlic cloves, unpeeled 2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p>FOR THE SUCCOTASH SALAD</p>
<p>6 ears corn, shucked or about 3 cups frozen corn (16 oz | 454 g) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups (12 oz) frozen lima beans or edamame 1 red bell pepper, diced 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 13 mm) 1 yellow bell pepper, diced 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 13 mm) 1/2 cup (2 1/2 oz) finely chopped red onion 2 cups (about 14 oz) grape tomatoes, halved 1/4 cup (1/2 oz) minced fresh parsley 3 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh mint leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>MAKE THE DRESSING</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).</p>
<p>Wrap the garlic cloves in aluminum foil. Roast until soft, about 30 minutes. When cool enough to handle, squeeze each garlic clove gently between your fingertips to release, discard the papery skins.</p>
<p>In the bottom of a large bowl, mash the roasted garlic cloves into a paste. Whisk in the vinegar, cream, and sugar until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oil until well blended.</p>
<p>MAKE THE SUCCOTASH SALAD</p>
<p>Heat a grill to medium-high.</p>
<p>Brush the ears of corn with the oil. Grill, turning occasionally, until tender and charred in spots, about 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the cobs and add them to the bowl with the dressing. (If using frozen corn, simply boil it with the lima beans in the next step.)</p>
<p>☞ TESTER TIP: To corral stray corn kernels as you cut them from the cob, place the ear of corn inside a deep, large bowl and use a sharp knife to trim downward, collecting the kernels in the bowl.</p>
<p>Fill a medium bowl with ice and water. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the lima beans to the boiling water and cook until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. (If using frozen corn, toss it in with the lima beans during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking.) Drain the beans, then transfer them to the ice water to cool. Drain again and add to the bowl with the dressing and corn. Add the bell peppers, onion, tomatoes, parsley, and mint to the bowl with the lima beans. Toss until evenly coated. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Cover the salad and chill for at least 30 minutes, or dump into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days before serving. (Editor’s note: This is one of those dishes that actually tastes better the longer it sits over the course of a day or two!)</p>

  <title>Lemon Rhubarb Cake</title>
  <dc:creator>EMMA GALLOWAY | MY DARLING LEMON THYME</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/lemon rhubarb cake.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>4 eggs 2/3 cup caster sugar 125g extra soft butter, or dairy-free margarine 2 3/4 cups (300g) ground almonds 1/3 cup (50g) brown rice flour 1 teaspoon baking powder the zest of 1 lemon 4 stalks of rhubarb (approx 150g) 2 teaspoons caster sugar, extra powdered sugar for dusting</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Pre-heat the oven to 180 C/356 F. Grease a 25 cm/9 inch cake tin and line the bottom with a round of baking paper. Wash the rhubarb stalks, cut into 1 inch lengths and while still slightly damp from washing combine in a small bowl with the 2tsp of extra caster sugar to coat and set aside.</p>
<p>Beat the eggs and sugar using either a hand-held electric beater or a stand-up mixer for 5 minutes until very thick and pale in colour. Slowly beat in the soft butter, then beat for a further few minutes. A few small lumps of butter will remain, this is okay. Gently fold in the almond meal, rice flour, baking powder and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin. Dot the rhubarb pieces on top, gently pushing them down into the batter a little. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cake comes out clean and the rhubarb is tender.</p>
<p>Cool in the tin before serving dusted with icing sugar and softly whipped cream on the side.</p>

  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/Rosemary Chicken with Leeks and Beans.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, or legs Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound leeks, white and light green only, cut into 1/4-inch coins, rinsed well 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary, plus more leaves for garnish 1 cup apple cider, (not apple juice) or chicken stock if you prefer a more savory take One (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and liquid reserved 3 tablespoons sour cream Zest of 1 lemon</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Crank up the oven to 350°F (175°C).</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</p>
<p>Generously season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Place them skin-side down in the pan and sear until the skin is irresistibly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Flip and cook a few minutes more. Transfer to a plate.</p>
<p>Lower the heat to medium, add the leeks, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Stir in the garlic and rosemary, season well with salt and pepper, and cook a minute more.</p>
<p>Nestle the chicken into the gorgeous greenery in the pan.</p>
<p>Splash in the apple cider.</p>
<p>Spoon the beans around the chicken and stir into the leeks. Add some of the reserved bean liquid if the leeks aren’t halfway covered with the cider.</p>
<p>Slide the pan into the oven and roast, uncovered, until the thighs are beautifully browned and register 165°F (74°C) on an instant-read thermometer and the beans are slightly crusted, 45 to 55 minutes. If the chicken is browning too quickly, cover the pan.</p>
<p>Remove the chicken from the oven and swirl in the sour cream.</p>
<p>Zest the lemon over the dish and carry it triumphantly to the table.</p>

  <title>Cuban Beans and Rice</title>
  <dc:creator>Leite&#39;s Culinaria</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/Cuban Beans and Rice.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>1 cup dried black beans 2 bay leaves 2 teaspoons kosher salt 3 slices bacon, coarsely chopped (about 100 g) 1 medium (7 oz) yellow onion, diced 1 medium (7 oz) green bell pepper, seeded and diced 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 cup long-grain white rice 1 3/4 cups store-bought or homemade chicken stock</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Place the beans in a large pot and cover with water by at least 3 inches (8 cm). Slide the pot in the refrigerator and let soak for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Drain the beans and return them to the pot. Add enough fresh cold water to cover the beans by about 1 inch (2.5 cm), toss in the bay leaves, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer until the beans are just tender, which can take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes, depending on the age of your beans. Add the salt and continue to cook for 15 minutes more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, sauté the bacon until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, move the bacon to a stack of paper towels placed on a plate.</p>
<p>Add the onion and pepper to the pan and cook in the bacon fat until the vegetables soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cumin, and oregano and cook, stirring, just until the garlic softens and the spice is fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Dump in the rice and stir constantly for a couple minutes to completely coat the rice with the bacon drippings. Then pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook until the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>When the beans are done, drain them, reserving at least 1/2 cup of the bean cooking liquid. Stir the beans into the pan containing the rice and continue cooking over medium-low heat until the rice is tender, 5 to 15 minutes more. If you need more liquid to fully cook the rice, use the reserved bean cooking liquid. Taste and adjust the seasoning to taste with salt. Stir in the bacon and serve the beans and rice immediately.</p>

  <title>Corn Chowder</title>
  <dc:creator>Leite&#39;s Culinaria</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/corn chowder.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>3 medium ears fresh yellow or bicolor corn 4 ounces slab (unsliced) bacon*, rind removed, cut into 1/3-inch dice 2 tablespoons (1 oz) unsalted butter 1 medium onion, (7 to 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/2 large red bell pepper, (6 to 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 to 2 sprigs thyme, leaves removed and chopped (1/2 teaspoon) 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/8 teaspoon turmeric 1 pound Yukon Gold, Maine, PEI, or other all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 3 cups homemade chicken stock or canned chicken broth kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 2 teaspoons cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons minced chives or thinly sliced scallions</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Husk the corn. Carefully remove most of the silk by hand and then rub the ears with a towel to finish the job. Slice the kernels from the cobs and place them a bowl. You should have about 2 cups. Using the back of your knife, scrape downwards along the cobs and add the milky substance that oozes out to the corn kernels. Discard the cobs.</p>
<p>Heat a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced bacon. Once it has rendered a few tablespoons fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the bacon is crisp and golden brown. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon fat, leaving the bacon in the pot.</p>
<p>Add the butter, onion, bell pepper, thyme, cumin, and turmeric and saute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, for about 8 minutes, until the onion and pepper are tender but not browned. Add the corn kernels, potatoes, and stock, turn up the heat, cover, and boil vigorously for about 10 minutes. Some of the potatoes will fall apart, but most should retain their shape.</p>
<p>Use the back of your spoon to smash a bit of the corn and potatoes against the side of the pot to thicken the chowder. Reduce the heat to medium and season the chowder with salt and pepper. Stir the cornstarch mixture and slowly pour it into the pot, stirring constantly. As soon as the chowder has come back to a boil and thickened slightly, remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>
<p>Ladle the chowder into cups or bowls and sprinkle with the chopped chives. Serve immediately or let it sit at room temperature for up to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld. If you aren’t serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool, then cover and refrigerate for up to a few days. Reheat the chowder over low heat and but don’t let it boil.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>1 pound pork shoulder, cut into bite-size cubes 1 medium (8 oz) yellow onion, chopped One (25-ounce) can hominy, undrained 3/4 cup water 3 or 4 garlic cloves, chopped 1 to 3 canned chipotle chiles in adobo, chopped, with 1 to 2 teaspoons adobo sauce from the can (about 1/2 small can) 2 teaspoons ancho chile powder, plus more if needed 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more if needed 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, for garnish (omit or use parsley instead)</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>In the insert of an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, combine the pork, onion, hominy and its juices, water, garlic, chipotle chiles, adobo sauce, ancho chile powder, cumin, oregano, and salt.</p>
<p>TESTER TIP: If you like your hominy more al dente, add half the can while cooking so it flavors and thickens the stew a bit, and save the other half to add after cooking.</p>
<p>Secure the lid on the Instant Pot or pressure cooker. Close the pressure-release valve. Cook over high pressure for 30 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, allow the pressure to release naturally, 15 to 20 minutes. The pork should be very tender.</p>
<p>Taste the stew and season with additional ancho chile powder and salt, if needed. Garnish with the cilantro and serve.</p>

  <title>Senate Bean Soup</title>
  <dc:creator>Leite&#39;s Culinaria</dc:creator>
  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/senate beans.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<p>Adapted From Heirloom Beans, by Rancho Gordo!</p>
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>1/2 pound dried navy beans* (or pretty much any variety of white bean) One (1 1/2-pound) smoked ham hock, cut crosswise into 3 or 4 pieces (you can ask your butcher to cut the ham hock for you) 6 cups water 1 bay leaf 1/2 medium yellow onion, chopped 4 celery stalks with leaves, chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus more for garnishing Salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Rinse the beans in lots of cool water and gently run your hands over the beans, checking them for small bits of debris. Pour the beans into a pot and cover with about 1 inch of cold water. Let the beans soak for anywhere from 2 to 6 hours. Drain the beans.</p>
<p>In a soup pot, combine the beans, ham hock, water, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently until the beans are beginning to soften, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>Add the onion, celery, garlic, 1/4 cup parsley, salt, and pepper to taste. Continue to simmer until the beans are soft and beginning to break down, and the ham meat comes off the bone easily when shredded with a fork, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>Remove the ham hock pieces. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones. Dice the meat and return it to the pot. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and garnish with parsley.</p>
<p><strong>Instant Pot Senate Bean Soup Variation</strong></p>
<p>To make this Senate bean soup in your Instant Pot, do not soak the beans. Decrease the water to 5 cups and cook on the manual setting for 45 minutes. Let the Instant Pot release naturally.</p>

  <link>https://questionable.quarto.pub/recipes/recipes/Mochi Donuts.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 
<section id="ingredients" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>MOCHI DONUTS</p>
<ul>
<li>150 g glutinous rice flour or mochiko</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>50 g unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>50 g brown sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
<li>200 g dairy or non-dairy milk</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<p>MATCHA WHITE CHOCOLATE GLAZE</p>
<ul>
<li>100 g white chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon matcha powder, ceremonial grade recommended</li>
</ul>
<p>WHITE CHOCOLATE BISCOFF GLAZE</p>
<ul>
<li>100 g white chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
<li>1 Lotus biscuit, crushed</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>MOCHI DONUTS</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°F and lightly grease a donut pan with cooking spray or softened butter. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir together glutinous rice flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In another small mixing bowl, stir together melted butter and brown sugar. Add in the egg and stir until the yolk has broken up and combined. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract. Add the dry mixture into the wet mixture and stir to combine until smooth. Spoon the batter (or use a piping bag) into the donut pan until almost full. Bake for 25-30 minutes until slightly browned on the edges. Stop at 25 minutes for softer donuts or 30 minutes for crisper donuts but be careful not to overbake otherwise they will be more hard than chewy. Let donuts cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes before lifting them out. Let cool completely on a wire rack before glazing.</p>
<p>MATCHA WHITE CHOCOLATE GLAZE</p>
<p>In a small pot, bring about 1” of water to a boil. In a heat-safe bowl that fits perfectly on top of the pot without touching the water, add the chopped white chocolate, oil, and matcha powder. Turn off the heat and place the bowl on top of pot to create a double boiler. Let the chocolate sit undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes until it has mostly melted. Stir with a spatula to mix the matcha and chocolate together and ensure there are no unmelted chunks. Transfer the melted chocolate to a small bowl. Dip the donuts into the chocolate and shake off the excess. Place on a wire rack to set. Drizzle with any remaining white chocolate if desired.</p>
<p>WHITE CHOCOLATE BISCOFF GLAZE</p>
<p>Use the same directions as the matcha glaze above but without the matcha powder. Sprinkle the glazed donuts with crushed biscuits while they’re still wet.</p>
<p>NOTES</p>
<p>Melting white chocolate in microwave: Microwave in 10 second intervals, stirring in between each zap. Stop when it’s mostly melted. Be careful not to overheat it otherwise the chocolate will seize. If you’re making both glazes, save time by melting all of the white chocolate (200g) together and divide into two bowls. Stir matcha powder into one half.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="lisas-notes">Lisa’s notes</h2>
<p>I used Matcha Green Tea icing instead, and it was delicious! Mix together 1 tsp of matcha powder, 1 tbls milk / oat milk, and powdered sugar until it reaches a thick consistency.</p>

<ul>
<li>3/4 cup mild vegetable oil</li>
<li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 medium (about 12 oz) red, orange, and/or yellow bell peppers, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 medium (about 3 1/2 oz) celery stalks, diced</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 medium (about 8 oz) yellow onion, diced</li>
<li>One (14-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Creole seasoning</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or more or less to taste</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>6 cups canned chicken broth or homemade chicken stock</li>
<li>1 pound andouille sausage (3 links), halved and sliced - - 1/2-inch (12-mm) thick</li>
<li>2 pounds skinless, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
<li>3 cups cooked rice, for serving</li>
<li>Fresh parsley, for serving</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="instructions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a large pot over medium heat, whisk together the oil and flour, and cook until the mixture turns golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the bell peppers, celery, garlic, onion, tomatoes, oregano, thyme, basil, Creole seasoning, chili powder, cayenne, and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. The roux will bubble and thicken up immediately into a paste that coats the vegetables.</li>
<li>Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the broth, sausage, and chicken. Bring the gumbo to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and gently simmer until the chicken is literally falling apart, at least 3 hours or up to all day (the longer the better as the flavors will meld).</li>
<li>Skim the fat off the surface of the gumbo. Remove and discard the chicken bones.</li>
<li>Divvy the rice among bowls and ladle the gumbo over the rice. Garnish with parsley. Store any leftovers refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>HOW TO MAKE THIS IN YOUR SLOW COOKER, PRESSURE COOKER, OR INSTANT POT</p>
<p>Pressure Cooker Or Instant Pot Variation</p>
<p>To make this chicken gumbo in the pressure cooker or Instant Pot use the sauté function to cook the roux as described in step 1 of the recipe above. Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the rice and parsley, lock the lid in place, and cook over high pressure for 35 minutes. Release the pressure, remove the lid, and discard the bones. Use the sauté function to bring the gumbo to a boil and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve over rice, garnished with parsley. Slow Cooker Variation</p>
<p>To make this chicken gumbo in the slow cooker, follow step 1 in the recipe above, then add the roux, and all remaining ingredients except the rice and parsley, to the slow cooker. Cover and cook until the chicken is falling off the bones, 6 to 8 hours on low, or 5 to 6 hours on high. Uncover, discard the chicken bones, then cook on high until the gumbo thickens slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve over rice, garnished with parsley.</p>

<section id="lisas-notes" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="lisas-notes">Lisa’s notes</h2>
<p>How can you go wrong with gumbo?</p>
<p>Use gluten free flour (with added xantham gum) for a gluten free experience.</p>
<p>Add some okra to bring it up a notch further.</p>

<p>In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the butter, chocolate, and cayenne pepper until the chocolate melts, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee and vanilla. Remove from the heat and let cool.</p>
<p>Using a stand mixer or handheld mixer on medium-high speed, whisk together the eggs and sugar until thick, pale, and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Pour the cooled chocolate mixture into the eggs, add the salt, and use a spatula to gently fold until everything is combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake is just cooked through with a slight wobble in the middle, 38 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and let the cake cool completely. As it cools, the surface will crack, and this is what you want!</p>
<p>If desired, dump some cocoa powder in a small strainer and tap it over the cake to generously dust it before serving.</p>

<p>We used 3/4 tsp cayenne and it was perfect.</p>
<p>Yes it’s whole eggs. I triple checked that it wasn’t a meringue, but somehow it works out!</p>
