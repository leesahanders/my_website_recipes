## Ingredients

12 eggs
2 tsp salt
2 Tbsp white vinegar
6 cloves garlic minced
2 Korean green peppers chopped
1 red chili chopped, optional
1 Tbsp sesame seeds
3 green onions chopped, optional
1 cup soy sauce
½ cup Korean rice syrup or honey
1 Tbsp sesame oil optional
½ cup water

## Instructions

In a pot, add in water (enough to cover all the eggs) and add salt and vinegar. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring the water to a simmer. Once the water is boiling, carefully add in the eggs and let the eggs cook for 6 minutes. (7 minutes if you are in Colorado)

After 6 minutes, remove the eggs and let them rest in a bowl of ice water for at least 10 minutes.

Peel the eggs carefully and set them aside.

In a container, add garlic, green pepper, red chili, green onion, soy sauce, rice syrup, sesame oil, and water. Mix till everything is combined.

Add in the peeled eggs and make sure the eggs are covered in the marinade.

Let the eggs rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours or, even better, overnight.
