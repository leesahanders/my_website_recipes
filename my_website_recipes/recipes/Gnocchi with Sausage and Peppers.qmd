## Ingredients

12 ounces fully cooked sweet chicken sausages, cut into-inch pieces

1 (16-ounce) package gnocchi, shelf-stable or thawed / frozen

8 ounces mixed baby bell peppers, seeded and quartered (about 2 cups)

1 pint cherry tomatoes

3 garlic cloves, peeled but whole

Fresh rosemary sprigs

1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Generous pinch of red pepper flakes, or more to taste

teaspoon kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

3 cups baby spinach

3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F

On a sheet pan, mix the sausages, gnocchi, bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, Italian seasoning, pepper flakes, salt, and

a few twists of black pepper Drizzle with the oil, toss well to combine, and spread the gnocchi and vegetables into one even layer

Bake for 12 minutes. Using a spatula, lift and turn all the ingredients to evenly cook. Return to the oven and cook until the sausages are golden brown, the gnocchi are plump and slightly golden, and the peppers are tender, about 15 minutes

To serve, evenly divide the spinach among 4 individual serving plates, top with the gnocchi/sausage mixture, and sprinkle with the Parmesan. If desired, garnish with chopped fresh parsley leaves or basil.

## Lisa's notes

Serve with arugula salad with a light drizzle of balsamic vinegar (and optionally, feta cheese). So good! 

Jesse note: Do not get the chickpea gnocchi. I don't know what to say about it...
