## Lisa's notes

A Texas staple. Best cooked over a grill or cast iron.

2025-05-10 notes: 

Threw some things in bag in the store parking lot (1.5 lbs flank steak), marinated 2 hours: 

- 7 jalapeno pepper slices and most of a bottle of lime juice
- Got to grasslands and added cumin (7 pinches) and chipotle powder (7 pinches) and some salt
- Maybe 7 hours marinated
- Cooked both sides, 4 min each side. Rest 15 min
- Served with guac, thinly sliced radishes, tenderly roasted peppers and onion, corn tortillas
