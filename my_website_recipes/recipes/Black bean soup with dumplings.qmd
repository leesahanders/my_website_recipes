## Ingredients

I recommend doubling this. Claims this makes 4 servings, but when hungry having a double batch goes a longer way (and uses the full bag of Rancho Gordo black beans). 

- 1 1/2 cups masa
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons lard (can be substituted with olive oil)
- Salt
- 1/4 of an onion, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, cut into halves or thirds
- 3 cups cooked Rancho Gordo Chiapas Black beans or other black beans
- 4 cups bean broth from the Chiapas beans
- 3 sprigs fresh epazote 


## Instructions

- In a mixing bowl, add 1 cup of masa and mix in ½ cup of water, 1 tablespoon of lard or oil, and ⅛ teaspoon of salt. Knead the masa into a ball to ensure the ingredients are well-mixed. The masa will be ready when there is no visible flour and it holds together without falling apart. This will be used to make the orejitas (masa balls).
- To make the orejitas, use the masa to make small balls, about the size of ping-pong balls, and make a dent in the center with your thumb.
- In a medium saucepan, boil 2½ cups of water. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and add the orejitas; let them cook for 10 minutes. Once the 10 minutes is over, leave the orejitas in the pot. You will use them later on. 
- In a blender, combine ½ cup of masa with 1½ cups of water and blend until there is no masa visible. Set aside; this will be used in the beans.
- In a soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon of lard or oil over medium-low heat. Add the sliced onion and garlic; saute until golden brown. Add the 3 springs of epazote, the beans, and the 4 cups of broth. Using a strainer, pass the masa-water mixture from the blender into the pot of beans, removing any lumps that may have formed. The color of the broth will become a bit lighter. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, then add the masa orejitas. Bring the pot to a simmer, and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings, then serve.

## Lisa's notes

Substituted parsley and added at the end as garnish, very yummy. Next time boil the dumplings in the bean soup water, no need to dirty an additional pan. 

Pressure cook the beans for 16-17 min. (14 was still a bit crunchy)
