## Ingredients

Crispy Tofu Bits (or tureky, chicken, etc): 

- 1 block extra firm tofu
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 cup teriyaki
- 1 clove garlic, grated

Miso Peanut Ramen:

- 1 tablespoon red curry paste or roasted red chili paste
- 1 tablespoon white miso
- 1-2 tablespoons peanut butter (just a little plop)
- 2 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 1/2 cups water + 1 1/2 teaspoons Better Than Bouillon roasted chicken or vegetable base (sub 1 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth)
- 1 (14-ounce) can full fat coconut milk
- 6 ounces uncooked ramen noodles (two 3-ounce packets, just the noodles)


## Instructions

Prep Tofu: Press tofu with paper towels to remove some of the water. Grate tofu on a box grater, on medium / large holes.

Crisp Tofu: Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu shreds; saute until golden and lightly crisped (it usually takes me 10-15 minutes to really get it to have some crispy / chewy texture).

Sauce Tofu: Add the teriyaki sauce and grated garlic to the “thirsty” tofu. Sauté for another 5-10 minutes to caramelize further. Add 1-2 tablespoons more sauce as desired. Transfer to a separate bowl and wipe out the pan.

Make Ramen Broth: In the same pan, heat the curry paste, miso, peanut butter, soy sauce, and brown sugar until it’s worked into a thick paste. Add the coconut milk and broth, and whisk until incorporated. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until slightly thickened and creamy.

Ramen: Meanwhile, boil ramen in a separate pot for 3-4 minutes; drain, and add to sauce. Simmer 1-2 minutes until the noodles are well-coated (and add more broth if you want it to be more soupy).

Serve: Transfer noodles into in bowls, and pour a scoop of the broth over the top. Top with the tofu, herbs, and chili crisp on top.
