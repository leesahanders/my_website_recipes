## Tools

- Food processer
- Microplane 

## Ingredients

- Egg (1) 
- Lemon juice (2tsp)
- Garlic (1-3 cloves)
- Mustard (like Dijon) from a bottle - not the yellow stuff (2-3 teaspoons)
- Neutral oil like canola, grapeseed

## Steps

- Put the whole egg in food processor with 2-3 teaspoons of mustard and lemon juice
- 1-3 cloves of garlic, zested 
- Pulse 
- Add a neutral oil drizzled very gently 
- It will start to come together
- Drizzle until it's thick. It will be a lot of oil, probably a half cup 
- Add a little bit of salt at the end, pulse it in. Salt will get stronger overnight while it sits so go light. 
- If for some reason the emulsion fails can use that liquid to add to another egg and re-try (use it as the liquid to drizzle in) 
- Sometimes she adds a little paprika, or could add other herbs for different flavors 

Serve with roast veg: 

- carrots, potatoes, rutabagas, turnups, beets, Chicken thighs with the skin on 
- Cook chicken on top of veggies (might have to take chicken off before veg is done) 
- For seasoning the veggies toss in olive oil, paprika, and celery salt
