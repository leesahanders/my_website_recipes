## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups jasmine rice
- 1 14-ounce can full fat coconut milk about 2 cups plus 1/3 cup water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 red bell peppers, chopped
- 1 cucumber, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 4 green onions, sliced
- 1 cup roasted cashews
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 2 limes, juiced (4 tbs lime juice)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons siracha

## Instructions

1. Rinse the rice well, until water no longer looks starchy. Drain well.
2. Open the can of coconut milk and scoop out the thick later of coconut cream, setting it aside. Pour the remaining coconut water in a large liquid measuring cup. Add enough water to the coconut water to measure 2 1/2 cups.
3. In a large pot, combine the coconut water and water mixture with the rice and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 15 minutes. Stir once during that 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the reserved coconut cream. Transfer to a large bowl to cool.
4. Meanwhile, make the dressing. Combine peanut butter, water, lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar and sriracha in a medium bowl. Whisk well. You may need to add a little more water to thin if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings.
5. Once the rice is cool, add the bell peppers, cucumber, carrots, green onions and cashews.
6. Serve drizzled with the peanut dressing.

## Lisa's notes

Reserving 1/4 c from the can of melted coconut milk also worked, though I'm sure the method as written would be even better. 

Add chicken (pan seared with soy sauce) to add some more protein if desired.
