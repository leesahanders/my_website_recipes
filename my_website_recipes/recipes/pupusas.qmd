Total Time: 45 mins

Servings: 5 servings

## Ingredients

1 package of seitan if vegan or meat

½ of a yellow onion diced 

½ (15.25-ounce) can of corn (optional)

½ (15-ounce) of refried beans (optional)

2 teaspoons of garlic powder

1 ½ teaspoon of salt

2 cups of corn flour (masa)

1 ½ cups of warm water or just enough for it to hold together

Salsa for serving (optional)

Masa harina: (NOT masarepa) We use Maseca corn flour (or Bob’s Red Mill).

## Instructions

- Heat seitan/meat, then add onions and saute for about 5 minutes
- (Optional) Mix in corn and beans, then set aside.
- In a large bowl, add the garlic powder and salt to the corn flour and then add enough water to have it all hold together.
- Take a small handful of masa and flatten it out big enough to make a little bowl with it in your hand, then add some filling, pinch up the sides up and pat flat.
- Use a nonstick pan or a bit of oil and cook on each side for about 4 minutes or until it gets golden brown.

Notes: 

> If there is cracking: You haven’t hydrated the dough enough. It’s a good idea to test this before assembling all the pupusas. To do so, take a golf-ball-sized piece of dough and flatten it. If large cracks bigger than ¼-inch form around the edges—add more water (a teaspoon or two at a time).

> Use warm water: (or even hot water) It helps hydrate the flour better than cold water for less cracking and more tender homemade pupusa dough.

> Use damp hands: The masa dough is sticky, so dipping your hands in water (or oil) as needed will make it easier to shape and flatten without sticking to your hands.

> Pinch off any excess: After filling and sealing the vegetarian pupusas, pinch away any excess dough and return it to the dough bowl, so they aren’t overly doughy.

> Cook untouched: Don’t move the pupusas as they cook, so they can form a nice crust and avoid sticking.

Eat them with: 

- Mexican rice, regular rice, or other grains like quinoa
- Homemade ‘slaw instead or curtido
- Guacamole
- Sriracha or other hot sauce
- Grilled vegetable kebabs
- Sweet potato fries
- A side salad
- Fresh salsa (like Pico de Gallo or blended salsa)
