## At a Glance

Serves 4

Total time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

Dressing

2 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger (about a 2-inch piece)

2 garlic cloves, minced

3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce

2 tablespoons rice vinegar

1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Wraps

3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken

3 cups shredded cabbage or coleslaw mix

1 cup shredded carrots

1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro or mint

4 (10-inch) flour, corn, or almond flour tortillas

## Instructions

Make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk together the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil. a pinch of salt, and a few twists of black pepper.

Make the wraps: To the bowl of dressing, add the chicken, cabbage, shredded carrots, and cilantro and mix together until well combined

Stack the tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and microwave for 45 seconds to help make them more pliable.

Lay the tortillas out on a work surface. Dividing evenly, top the bottom half of the tortillas with the chicken mixture. Roll up the wrap by folding the left and right sides of the tortillas over the filling.

Fold the bottom flap over the filling and roll the wrap closed. Slice in half on the diagonal and serve.
