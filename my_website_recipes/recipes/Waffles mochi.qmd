## Ingredients

Consider making a double batch :) 

- 3/4 cups milk
- 1 egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cup mochiko flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

In a medium mixing bowl add milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined. Set aside.

In another medium mixing bowl add mochiko flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined.

Add wet ingredients to dry. Whisk until just combined.

Spray nonstick cooking spray on the waffle iron. Add 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of the batter to the waffle iron. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown.

Add toppings of your choice and ENJOY!

## Lisa's notes

This makes 3 waffles. Highly recommend a double batch!

I really like a sweet and savory combo - so I like to have a mochi waffle, some kind of jam or compote, and then topped with a fried egg.
