## Ingredients

Per person:

- Ramen noodles 3 oz
- Chicken packets (optional)
- Peanuts 0.8 oz (optional, add craisins/raisins)
- Peanut butter 1.3 oz
- Toasted sesame oil 0.2 oz
- Soy sauce 0.2 oz 
- Coconut milk powder 0.1 oz 
- Garlic 0.1 oz 
- Ginger powder (1/8 tsp)
- Siracha 0.03 oz 
- [Lime (dehydrated)](https://www.amazon.com/Grelim-Gluten-Free-Squeezed-Beverages-Smoothies/dp/B0BY8ZNV4L/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2886HENCPMRR9&keywords=dehydrated%2Blime%2Bpowder&qid=1693600008&sprefix=dehydrated%2Blime%2Bpowde%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-5&th=1) 0.02 oz 

## Instructions

At home: 

- The sauce should be made at home. Mix all of the sauce ingredients.
- If you prefer smaller noodle pieces to long, stringy ones, crush the noodles before opening the package. But be careful — the package can rip open.
- Discard the “flavor” packet, which isn’t necessary and might over-salt the meal.
- Andrew recommends using a 4 or 8 oz nalgene wide mouth, but we used human gear small tubs and it worked great. 

At camp: 

- Add the peanut sauce at any time.
- Bring to a boil at least 8 oz of water.
- Add the Ramen and the toppings (crushed nuts, craisins, red peppers), turn off the stove or let it burn out. Beware of boil-over. Allow the noodles sit for 5 minutes before enjoying.
- Remove and reserve some water if needed
- To get the sauce out of the bottle, we add water and shake vigorously. A 32-ounce bottle becomes very clean after two or three rounds.

## Lisa's notes

This is the camp meal of your dreams when backpacking. Added green onion because we weren't going rigorously light weight and it was so good.
