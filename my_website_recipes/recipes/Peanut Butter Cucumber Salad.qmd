## At a Glance

Don't worry bout it :) 

## Ingredients

- 2 English cucumbers
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 green onion (optional)
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds, ground
- Kosher salt, to taste

Dressing 

- 3 tbsp peanut butter
- 1 tbsp Korean chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tsp toasted sesame oil

If you don't have gochugaru you can use 0.5 tbs korean red chili powder and 1 tbs red chili flakes. 

## Instructions

1. Trim off the ends of the cucumbers and cut them into bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Finely chop the garlic cloves and thinly slice the green onion (if using).
2. Make the dressing: In a small container, combine all the dressing ingredients with the minced garlic. Mix until smooth and well combined.
3. Pour the dressing over the cucumbers, add 1 tablespoon of freshly ground sesame seeds, and gently toss until everything is evenly coated. Taste and add more salt if needed. Enjoy!
