## At a Glance

Serves: ⅔ cup (about 4 servings)

## Ingredients

2 tablespoons dairy-free buttery spread

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (can sub wheat flour for "tan" sauce; use sweet white rice flour for gluten free)

½ cup unsweetened dairy-free half & half (I used Ripple Original)

½ cup water, plus additional as needed

¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste

Black or white pepper, to taste (optional)

Pinch nutmeg (optional)

## Instructions

Melt the buttery spread in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Whisk in the flour until smooth and bubbly.

Gradually add the half & half, while whisking, until smooth.

Gradually add the water, while whisking, until smooth.

Whisk and cook until thickened to your desired consistency. If it thickens too much, whisk in a little more water.
Season with the salt and pepper or nutmeg (if using).

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat and whisk until smooth before using. Add more water, if needed.

**Super-Creamy Option:** Reduce the buttery spread and flour to 1 tablespoon each. Increase the dairy-free half & half to 1 cup and omit the water. This very thick sauce can be seasoned and used in layered dishes, or stirred into another sauce, soup, pasta, or rice dish.

## Lisa's notes

Make this to go over hot brown! Toast with layered turkey and tomato, drench in white sauce, add a bacon slice on top. Perfect for thanksgiving leftovers and to complete the food coma.
