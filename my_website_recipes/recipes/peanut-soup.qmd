## At a Glance

Yield: 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 3⁄4 cup roasted and shelled peanuts
- 2 tablespoons peanut or neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn
- 1 medium red or white onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1⁄2 pound skinless, boneless chicken (about 2 thighs or breasts) cut into chunks
- Pinch of cayenne
- Salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 6 cups stock or water
- 2 sweet potatoes or yams (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into thick slices
- 8 plum tomatoes, cored and halved (canned are supposedly fine; drain and reserve liquid for another use, but Lisa strongly recommends actual tomatoes)
- 1⁄2 pound collards or kale, washedand cut into wide ribbons
- 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 cup peanut butter, chunky or smooth


## Instructions

Step 1
Chop peanuts, or crush them with the side of a knife, or pulse
them in a food processor to chop roughly.

Step 2
Put oil in a deep skillet or medium saucepan over medium heat; a
minute later, add onion, ginger and garlic and cook, stirring
occasionally, until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chicken and
continue cooking for another 3 or 4 minutes, until just coloring.
Add 1⁄2 cup peanuts and the cayenne and sprinkle with salt and
pepper.

Step 3
Stir in the stock and the sweet potatoes, bring to a boil, and turn
heat down to medium-low so the soup bubbles gently. Stir in
tomatoes and collards, then cook, stirring occasionally, until
chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Step 4
Stir in 1⁄4 cup peanut butter. Taste, adjust seasoning (you may
want to add more peanut butter at this point) and serve, 
garnished with remaining peanuts.

## Lisa's notes

Use real tomatoes, not canned

1/8th teaspoon cayenne

Double the recipe

Reduce the liquid (8 c stock seems right)

Cook chard on side with garlic
