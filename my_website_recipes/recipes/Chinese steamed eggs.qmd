## At a Glance


## Ingredients

2 large eggs, beaten

3/4 cup warm water or chicken broth

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce

1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

1 scallion, thinly sliced

## Instructions

In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, water, and a pinch of salt and whisk until combined.

Set a sieve over a 3-cup heatproof serving bowl. Pour the egg mixture evenly through the sieve to remove air bubbles. Cover with an inverted heatproof plate.

Place a steamer or a steamer rack in a pot and fill the pot with water until it reaches just below the rack. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.

Reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently place the covered bowl in the steamer, cover the pot, and steam until solid yet still jiggly, about 12 minutes.

Carefully remove the bowl from the steamer. Garnish with soy sauce, sesame oil, and scallions. If desired, use a knife to cut through the surface of the curd in a cross-hatch design to allow the sauce to seep into the eggs.

## Lisa's notes

At elevation (5k feet) cooked for 13 min (rounding up, may have been closer to 14). 

Added avocado on top and it was heavenly.
