## Ingredients

1 cup short-grain brown rice, rinsed

11/2 cups water

1 pound ground chicken

1 tablespoon canola oil

1 Thai or jalape√±o chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced

2 teaspoons grated lime zest plus 1 tablespoon juice

2 tablespoons fish sauce

1 teaspoon cornstarch

1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

3 scallions, sliced thin

1/4 cup unsalted dry roasted peanuts, chopped

12 Bibb or Boston lettuce leaves

## Instructions

1. Bring rice and water to simmer in medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Off heat, lay clean dish towel under-neath lid and let rice sit for 10 minutes.

2. Mash chicken in bowl with back of wooden spoon until smooth and no strand-like pieces of meat remain. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add ground chicken, chile, and lime zest and cook, breaking up meat with spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.

3. Whisk lime juice, fish sauce, and cornstarch together, then add to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce has thick-ened, about 45 seconds. Off heat, stir in basil, scallions, and peanuts. Gently fluff rice with fork. Divide chicken filling and rice evenly among lettuce leaves and serve.


## Lisa's notes

Oat groats instead of brown rice works too and is delicious!
