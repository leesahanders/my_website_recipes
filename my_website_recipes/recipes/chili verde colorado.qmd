## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- 1 1/2 lb. pork stew meat (cubed)
- pepper
- salt
- 1 yellow onion (large, diced)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 cups green chiles (chopped, roasted)
- 14.5 oz. tomatoes with juice (diced)
- 1 1/2 cups salsa (tomatillo)
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 pinch ground cloves
- 5-6 tomatillos
- Roasted peppers (2 anaheim, 2 poblano)

## Instruction

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Season pork with salt and pepper, then cook in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, about 7 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate.

2. Reduce the heat to medium; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Return pork to the pot; stir in chicken broth, green chiles, diced tomatoes with juice, and tomatillo salsa. Season with oregano and ground cloves. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.

3. After 20 minutes, transfer 2 cups of soup (without any pork pieces) to a blender. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Purée until smooth, then pour back into the cooking pot. This will create a thicker texture for your chili and will eliminate some of the chunky bits of chiles. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender, at least 35 minutes more.

## Lisa's notes

Delicious! Extra green chilies roasted and then peeled added extra flavor. 12 hours in an instant pot, tomatillos added while simmering, puree step was skipped. Serve over potatoes, cornbread, or cornpone.
