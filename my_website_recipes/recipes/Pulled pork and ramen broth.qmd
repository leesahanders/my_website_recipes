## Pulled pork 

- One shoulder - usually 10 lbs or maybe 20 lbs (bone in) 
- Rub on pork 
- Chili powder, cumin, brown sugar, salt (kosher- good course salt) maybe a little cinnamon sometimes 
- Rub it all over 
- Put in instant pot 
- Pour water over it so it's mostly covered 
- Slow cook high 8-10 hours 

## Turn the leftover broth into ramen

- Put frozen leftover broth into instant pot. Add some water (1 inch at bottom)
- Pressure cook mode 1 minute (just to melt it)

Add as desired: 

- Soy sauce 
- Sesame oil 
- Jammy eggs 
- Seaweed 
- Ramen noodles 
- Sriracha 
- Jesse's soy sauce chicken
