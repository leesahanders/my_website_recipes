## Ingredients

-   2 pounds small carrots, preferably multicolored
-   2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   ¾ teaspoon salt
-   3 tablespoons butter
-   2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage or 2 teaspoons dried, plus more for garnish

## Instructions

1.  Position racks in upper and lower third of oven; preheat to 450°F.
2.  Trim carrots and cut in half lengthwise. Toss with oil and salt in a large bowl. Divide between 2 large rimmed baking sheets and spread in an even layer.
3.  Roast the carrots, stirring once and switching the pans top to bottom halfway through, until tender, about 15 minutes.
4.  Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until just starting to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. When the butter stops bubbling, stir in sage. Transfer the carrots to a serving dish and drizzle the sage brown butter over them. Garnish with fresh sage, if desired.

## Lisa's notes

The deliciousness of sage always amazes me, and the leftover sage butter can be used with just about anything afterwards.
