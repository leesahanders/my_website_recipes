The recipe amounts provided will feed approximately four people. However, this is a "recipe" that easily feeds a crowd. I typically make a big pot of chili and then set out all the other ingredients alongside the chili.

Everyone builds their own "Frito Pie" with however much of each ingredient that they would like.
