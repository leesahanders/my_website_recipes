## Ingredients

¾ cup sugar
½ cup orange juice
½ cup water
12 oz fresh cranberries rinsed and picked through
pinch of salt
1 cinnamon stick
1 piece of orange peel just use a potato peel or paring knife

## Instructions

Combine sugar, orange juice, and water in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir to combine.
Add cranberries, salt, cinnamon stick and orange peel.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently.
Continue cooking, for about 10 minutes, or until all or most of the cranberries have popped. I like to leave a handful of berries whole.
Let cool for at least 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Can be made up to 3 days in advance.
