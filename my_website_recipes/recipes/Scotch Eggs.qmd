## Ingredients

6 eggs

for the sausage meat (or just use a seasoned italian sausage):

- 455g of extra lean ground pork (pork mince)
- 1 small onion, diced finely
- 1 teaspoon of paprika
- ½ teaspoon of fennel seeds, crushed
- ½ teaspoon of ground sage (or can use fresh sage leaves)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- pinch black pepper
- ½ tbs of maple syrup or honey

for the coating: 

- 30g of almond meal
- 1 tbs of arrowroot flour (or can use tapioca or cornstarch)
- ½ teaspoon of paprika
- ½ teaspoon of dried parsley
- pinch of salt and pepper
- avocado spray oil (or another spray oil of choice)

## Instructions

Add the eggs to a saucepan and cover with water, bring to a boil, turn off heat, add lid and leave for 2.5 minutes and then add straight to a bowl of ice and water to stop them cooking any further. (can do this part the night before)

Once fully cooled carefully peel the shells of the eggs and set aside.

Spray a frying pan with avocado spray oil over a medium high heat

Add the onion and a little pinch of salt and fry until golden and softened, keep adding a little water in a reduce down to prevent any sticking, this will also help the onion to cook until really soft.

Add to a bowl, along with the ground pork (pork mince), the 1 teaspoon of paprika, plus the fennel, sage, black pepper and maple syrup and mix to combine.

Divide into 6 equal size balls.

On a plate add the almond meal, arrowroot, ½ teaspoon of paprika, parsley and a pinch of salt and black pepper and just mix all up to combine.

Preheat oven to 200c/400f

Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

Grab one ball of the sausage meat and flatten in hand. Add one egg and mold the sausage meal all around the egg so it froms a ball.

Roll in the almond meal mix, place onto the baking tray.

Repeat with the other 5 eggs.

Once all scotch eggs are formed and on the baking tray, lightly mist over the top with some avocado spray oil.

Place in the oven and bake for approx 20 minutes until sausage is cooked and the scotch eggs are lightly golden all over.

Serve and enjoy!!
