## Ingredients

- The base of it is black tea (anything will do, or rooibos for decaf) 
- Cardamom and peppercorn 3-4:1 
- Handful of cardamom, 1/4 handful of peppercorn 

Everything else is adjunctive

- Ginger (whole is great)
- Star anise 
- Cinnamon 
- Cloves (when you want to make it edgy) - playing with fire y'know cause it's intense
- Fuck, you could throw some cayenne in there if you want 

## Instructions

Mash up whole spices ideally 

Then you get all that going in a pot 

Throw them all together and boil it down - I do black tea first but cardamom later but any way could do 

Add thickening, cream element (oat milk, coconut milk) 

Recommend also Irish cream - like Bailey's 

Coconut and rum or whisky would be good 

I mix everything then filter it 

That's pretty much it - Yeah get crazy dude, the world's your fucking oyster with chai tea 

## Lisa's note

1-3 clove
1-3 pepper 
1 anise
2-4 tbs roibos
