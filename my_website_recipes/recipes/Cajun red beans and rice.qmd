## Ingredients

16 ounces dried red beans or kidney beans soaked and sorted
15 cups water Read instructions for the water break down
6 large ham hocks or chicken stock
2½ cups celery diced
1 large yellow onion diced
2 cups green bell pepper diced
5 bay leaves whole
2 teaspoons white pepper
2 teaspoons thyme leaves
1½ teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon oregano dried
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper or to taste
kosher salt to taste
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon Louisiana hot sauce or to taste
1 pound Andouille smoked sausage thinly sliced
5 cups cooked white rice

## Instructions

Sort and rinse the red beans. Cover the beans with cold water about 2 inches above the red beans. Let the beans soak overnight. Drain and rinse the beans under cold water before cooking them. (This does not include water listed in the recipe)

Place the ham hocks, 9 cups of water, celery, yellow onions, green bell peppers, bay leaves, and seasonings in a 6-quart sizeable Dutch oven; stir the mixture well. Cover the Dutch Oven with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a full boil over high heat. Remove the cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Remove the ham hocks from the Dutch Oven and set them to the side. (Shred the ham hocks while waiting) Do not discard the water in the Dutch Oven

Add the drained and rinsed beans and about 4 more cups of the water to the Dutch Oven; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Next, add two more cups of water and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often. Add the sliced andouille sausage and continue simmering for about 25-35 minutes, Stirring the bottom of the Dutch oven to ensure the beans do not stick.

Add the shredded ham hocks to the Dutch Oven and cook and stir for 10 minutes more.

Serve over long-grain rice and add hot sauce and green scallions for a little more kick.

## Lisa's notes

Substitute 2 pieces of bacon for the ham hocks. 

You can substitute polish sausage for andouille.
