## Ingredients

3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce

2 tablespoons oyster sauce

2 tablespoons light brown sugar

2 tablespoons canola oil

3 garlic cloves, minced

1 to 2 Thai chiles or 1 to 2 serrano peppers, seeded and finely chopped

1 medium shallot, halved and thinly sliced

1 pound ground chicken (see Note)

6 ounces green beans, trimmed and halved (about 2 cups)

1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced into strips

1 cup loosely packed fresh Thai basil leaves or Italian basil, thinly sliced

Steamed Rice (page 158), for serving

## Instructions

In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and brown sugar. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. When the oil is sizzling, add the garlic, chiles, and shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until the shallot softens slightly, about 1 minute.

Add the ground chicken and cook, using a spoon to break it up into small bits, stirring occasionally, until it just begins to brown on the outside, about 3 minutes.

Add the green beans and bell pepper, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegeta-bles are crisp-tender, 5 to 8 minutes.

Stir in the reserved sauce and cook until the sugar melts and the chicken is well coated, about 1 minute. Stir in the basil. Serve over rice.

## Lisa's notes

Mix Edamame into the rice for a meal with higher protein and fiber. Add some garlic chili sauce for crunch and deliciousness.
