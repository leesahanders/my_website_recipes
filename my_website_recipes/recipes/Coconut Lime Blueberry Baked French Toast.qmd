## At a Glance

Warning: This requires preparation in advance! Make it the night before so it is ready to bake in the morning. 

## Ingredients

1 loaf crusty French bread, cut into 1” cubes

8 large eggs

1 14-oz. can full-fat coconut milk

1/2 cup brown sugar, packed

2 tsp. vanilla extract

1/2 tsp. kosher salt

Zest and juice of 1 large lime

2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen

1/2 cup shredded, unsweetened coconut

Coconut oil, for greasing the baking dish

## Instructions

Prepare this breakfast casserole the night before you want to enjoy it. Start by greasing a 9x13” baking dish lightly with coconut oil (or cooking spray).

Arrange cubed French bread evenly into baking dish.

Prepare custard. In a large mixing bowl, whisk eggs, coconut milk, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, lime zest and juice.
Pour custard mixture evenly over bread cubes in the baking dish. Scatter blueberries evenly over bread and custard. Last, scatter shredded coconut over the top of the casserole.

Cover casserole, and refrigerate overnight.

In the morning, remove casserole from the fridge and let come to room temperature while the oven preheats to 350 degrees F.

Bake casserole, uncovered, for 50-60 minutes (50 minutes for softer texture, 60 minutes for firmer texture).
Serve with maple syrup (optional).
