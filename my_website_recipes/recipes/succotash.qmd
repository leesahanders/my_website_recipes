1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar

FOR THE SUCCOTASH SALAD

6 ears corn, shucked or about 3 cups frozen corn (16 oz | 454 g)

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

2 cups (12 oz) frozen lima beans or edamame

1 red bell pepper, diced 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 13 mm)

1 yellow bell pepper, diced 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 13 mm)

1/2 cup (2 1/2 oz) finely chopped red onion

2 cups (about 14 oz) grape tomatoes, halved

1/4 cup (1/2 oz) minced fresh parsley

3 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh mint leaves

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

MAKE THE DRESSING

Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).

Wrap the garlic cloves in aluminum foil. Roast until soft, about 30 minutes. When cool enough to handle, squeeze each garlic clove gently between your fingertips to release, discard the papery skins.

In the bottom of a large bowl, mash the roasted garlic cloves into a paste. Whisk in the vinegar, cream, and sugar until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oil until well blended.

MAKE THE SUCCOTASH SALAD

Heat a grill to medium-high.

Brush the ears of corn with the oil. Grill, turning occasionally, until tender and charred in spots, about 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to cut the kernels from the cobs and add them to the bowl with the dressing. (If using frozen corn, simply boil it with the lima beans in the next step.)

☞ TESTER TIP: To corral stray corn kernels as you cut them from the cob, place the ear of corn inside a deep, large bowl and use a sharp knife to trim downward, collecting the kernels in the bowl.

Fill a medium bowl with ice and water. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Add the lima beans to the boiling water and cook until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. (If using frozen corn, toss it in with the lima beans during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking.) Drain the beans, then transfer them to the ice water to cool. Drain again and add to the bowl with the dressing and corn.
Add the bell peppers, onion, tomatoes, parsley, and mint to the bowl with the lima beans. Toss until evenly coated. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste.
Cover the salad and chill for at least 30 minutes, or dump into an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days before serving. (Editor’s note: This is one of those dishes that actually tastes better the longer it sits over the course of a day or two!)
