## Gluten free adaption: 

Chocolate Heart Waffles recipe: 

- Some coconut oil 
- 1/2 c sugar
- 4 TBS dark cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 1/2 c almond flour 
- 1/2 c millet flour 
- 1/2 c brown rice flour 
- 1/4 tsp xanthum gum
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt 
- 2 eggs 
- Hazelnuts to taste. 
- Slightly warm water to texture 

Make sure that all wet ingredients are room temperature. If they are cold then the coconut oil will harden which is no good. 

Mix the sugar and coconut oil together. Then mix in cocoa powder, a little vanilla. 

Mix in other dry ingredients. Mix in the slightly warm water. Add the hazelnuts or other nuts (if desired).

Cook in the waffle iron until done (crispy on the edges but not burnt, or however you like your waffles).

## Lisa's notes

Super delicious! Serve with a layer of sunbutter and marshmallows toasted in a toaster oven with bagel mode for ultimate decadence. 

1:1 replacement with gluten free flour, consider adding a teaspoon of xanthum gum for better consistency.
