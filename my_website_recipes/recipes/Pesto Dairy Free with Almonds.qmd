## Ingredients

- 1 Big Handful Basil roughly 1 cup
- 1 Cup Spinach - or can add another cup of basil
- ½ Cup Olive Oil
- 1 Garlic clove - or like 4 or 5 if you like garlic
- Juice of ½ - 1 lemon
- ¼ teaspoon Salt
- ⅓ Cup Almonds

## Instructions

- Add all ingredients except almonds to a food processor. Pulse for 30 seconds - 1 minute, until everything is combined.
- Add the almonds and process for a few seconds at a time, until they are incorporated into the sauce. Do this more or less, depending on the consistency you like your pesto. Less pulsing will lead to chunkier pesto.
- Pour in a bowl for dipping, or directly on warm pasta, or spread on a sandwich. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze in an ice cube tray for up to 6 months.

## Lisa's notes

Good luck having enough that you need to store leftovers!
