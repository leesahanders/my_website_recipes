## At a Glance

For four 6-inch pancakes/crepes

Approximate nutrition info per batch: 344 calories, 29g fat, 2.5g net carbs, 17g protein

## Ingredients

2 oz cream cheese
2 eggs
1 packet stevia (or any) sweetener
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

## Instructions

Put all ingredients in a blender or magic bullet.  Blend until smooth.  Let rest for 2 minutes so the bubbles can settle.  Pour 1/4 of the batter into a hot pan greased with butter or pam spray.  Cook for 2 minutes until golden, flip and cook 1 minute on the other side.  Repeat with the rest of the batter.  Serve with sugar free syrup (or any syrup of your choice) and fresh berries.  A surprisingly satisfying substitute for the real thing.  Tastes like skinny fried cheesecakes!  Even if you aren't watching your carbs these are a delicious departure from the traditional doughy stack of pancakes.  And you won't have the sleepy feeling that usually comes afterwards!
