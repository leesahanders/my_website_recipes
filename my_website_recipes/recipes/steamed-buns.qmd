Small Round Parchment Paper

## Ingredients

Ingredients

To activate the yeast:

5 gr instant yeast
1 tsp sugar
2 Tbsp warm water (not hot)

Dry ingredients for the dough (I highly recommend using a measuring scale):

88 gr cornstarch plus more for dusting as needed. See notes
43 gr potato starch
45 gr glutinous rice flour
50 gr rice flour
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt
30 gr sugar

Wet ingredients for the dough:

80 ml water or dairy/non-dairy milk start with this amount. I used about 130 ml
30 ml cooking oil

For the gluten-free meat filling (you can use whatever filling you like):

1 Tbsp cooking oil
1 large onion peeled and finely chopped
120 gr leftover chicken meat (diced or shredded) (4.2 oz) or you can use about 200 grams (7 oz) raw chicken or pork
1 Tbsp tamari or coconut aminos. More or less to your taste
2 Tbsp brown sugar or more to your taste
1 tsp sesame oil
¼ tsp ground black pepper

To thicken the filling:

2 tsp cornstarch
1 Tbsp water


## Instructions

Prepare the filling (can be done few days before and keep in the fridge):
Preheat a skillet or wok. Add cooking oil and saute onion until they are soft and aromatic, about 3 minutes or so. Add chicken meat and the rest of the ingredients. If you use raw meat, continue to cook until the meat is cooked through. Have a taste. The filling should be savory and sweet. Adjust by adding more tamari/coconut aminos and/or brown sugar to your taste
When you are happy with the taste. Mix the cornstarch with water and pour it into the skillet/wok to thicken the filling. Remove from the heat and let the filling cools down completely before wrapping or store in the fridge if not using it immediately

Activate the yeast:

Put all ingredients in the bowl and stir to mix. Let it sits for 10 minutes. The mixture should be foamy and bubbly, which indicates that the yeast is still active. If it doesn't after 10 minutes, the yeast is no longer working and you need to get a new one before proceeding with the recipe
Prepare the dough:
Stir all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl to mix them up. Add the yeast mixture. Then gradually add the water/milk and oil and stir to roughly mix. Don't add all the water/milk yet, start with about 80 ml of it and gradually add. This is important as different brand of flour may have slightly different liquid absorption capacity. Use one of your clean hands to knead it into a dough. The dough should feel a bit wet and moist but not sticky to your fingers. If the dough feels dry , cracking, and falls apart, add a bit more liquid, a teaspoon at a time until it comes together. It should feel like a "playdoh". The dough doesn't have any elasticity
First proofing until doubles in size:
Cover and put the dough in a warm place. I put mine in the oven and use the "bread proof" function. It took a bit over 1 hour for the dough to double in size. Don't go by time. It may be faster or longer depending on the temperature

Shape and fill the dough:

Scoop the proofed dough out onto a working surface, lightly dusted with cornstarch. Use your clean hands to gather the dough back into one large dough and then divide into 8 equal portions. Keep them covered and work with one dough at a time
Prepare a small cup of water next to you in case you need it to help you shape the dough. Roll the dough into a round ball and then use your thumb to gently press it in and then to the side to form a bowl (as shown in the photo and video). Put the filling inside the cavity. Gently mold the dough to seal the filling. If at any point the dough feels dry and crackly, dab the dough with a bit of water and then roll it into a smooth round ball. Place this on parchment paper and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the rest of the dough balls.

Second proofing:

Place the shaped buns at a warm place again to let them proof until they are about 50% of their original size (they won't double in size). This round will be faster, about15-30 minutes, but please don't go by time. The dough needs to feel somewhat lighter when you lift them up and about 50% puffy

Steaming:

Get the steamer ready by bringing the water in the steamer to a rolling boil. Place the shaped buns inside a steaming basket or on a steaming rack. If you have a 3-tiered steamer, you can steam them all at once. Otherwise, you need to steam in batches. Lower the heat to medium and let the buns steamed for 8 minutes. After 8 minutes, turn off the heat and wait for 1 minute before opening the lid
Remove the steamed buns from the steamer and place them on a cooling rack. This is to prevent the bottom of the steamed buns from getting soggy from trapped condensation at the bottom

Serve:

Gluten-free steamed buns (or any steamed buns gluten-free or not) are best served warm. Gluten-free steamed buns will harden considerably when they have cooled down completely and after refrigeration. Simply reheat in a microwave or in the steamer and they will be as good as new
