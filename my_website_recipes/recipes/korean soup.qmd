## Instructions

At home:

- Combine all ingredients but water and tofu in a zip top bag. Write how much water needs to be added with a permanent marker directly on the bag.

At camp: 

- Carefully open tofu box and drain any liquid into your pot. Cut tofu into large cubes and set aside.
- Add two cups of water to the pot along with the contents of the zip top bag and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer and stir making sure bouillon cube is totally dissolved.
- Add tofu cubes and let simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through.
