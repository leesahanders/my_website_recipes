## Ingredients

- Corn tortilla 

- Pizza sauce

- Any cheese type toppings you want 

- Any pizza toppings you want (olives, anaheim pepper, pepperoni are all great!)

## Instructions

Pan heat the corn tortilla on the stovetop until it gets crispy. This is the key - it needs to be crispy so it won't collapse later. 

Transfer the corn tortilla to a baking sheet and add sauce, cheese, and toppings

Cook at 400F ish until it smells amazing and the cheese has been as melted as is desired. 

Add red pepper flakes and salt to serve as desired.
