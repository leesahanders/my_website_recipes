## Ingredients

FOR THE HAZELNUT CRUST:

-  1⁄4 cups/180 grams raw hazelnuts
-  1 cup/125 grams rice flour
-  1⁄4 teaspoon salt
-  1⁄2 cup/112 grams sugar
-  6 tablespoons/100 grams softened butter, more as necessary

FOR THE CRANBERRY CURD:

-  12 ounces/340 grams cranberries
-  1 cup/225 grams sugar
-  Juice and peel (orange part only) of 1 orange
-  4 ounces/113 grams softened
-  butter (1 stick)
-  2 eggs plus 2 egg yolks

## Instructions

Step 1
Make the crust: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Put hazelnuts on a
baking sheet and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until skins darken
and crack. Put roasted nuts in a clean towel and rub off skins.
Discard skins and let nuts cool.

Step 2
In a food processor, grind nuts with half the rice flour until
mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add remaining rice flour
and salt and pulse briefly.

Step 3
Cream sugar and butter in a mixing bowl with a wooden spoon
for a minute or two until pale and thick. Add nut mixture and
combine until dough comes together. If it seems crumbly, add
1 to 2 tablespoons softened butter or a little cold water.

Step 4
Press dough evenly into a 10-inch French tart pan; use half the
dough for the sides and half for the bottom. Prick bottom with
a fork and freeze for 30 minutes (or several days if desired).

Step 5
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake chilled tart shell about 15
minutes until lightly brown. Cool.

Step 6
Make the cranberry curd: Put cranberries, sugar and orange
juice and peel in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until
cranberries have popped and softened, about 10 minutes.
Transfer to a food mill or medium mesh sieve and press
cooking liquid into a bowl. Whisk the butter into the warm
liquid.

Step 7
Put eggs and egg yolks into a bowl and beat lightly. Slowly
whisk a cup of warm cranberry liquid into the eggs to temper,
then combine both and whisk together. Wipe out pot if
necessary, return liquid to pot and cook over low heat until
nearly bubbling and thickened, about 10 minutes. If using
immediately, let cool to room temperature. If working ahead,
cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap (press wrap
against curd) and refrigerate. (Curd may be cooked up to 1 day
ahead.)

Step 8
Pour cooled cranberry curd into the cooled prebaked tart shell
and smooth top with a spatula. Bake at 350 degrees for 10
minutes to set curd. Cool on a rack. Store at room temperature
for up to 2 days.

## Lisa's notes

This pie recipe will make someone fall in love with you. 

Immersion blender superiority here, and leave the cranberry skins on for a more vibrant pie.
