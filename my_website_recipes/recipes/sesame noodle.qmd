## Ingredients

1 pound spaghetti or angel hair pasta

1 to 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes, depending on your heat tolerance

1/4 cup mild vegetable oil

1/4 cup toasted sesame oil

6 tablespoons honey

5 tablespoons soy sauce

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped

3/4 cup chopped roasted salted peanuts

1/2 cup chopped scallions

2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, toasted

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to directions and drain in a , but donâ€™t rinse.

While pasta is cooking, in a small skillet over medium heat, warm crushed red pepper and oils until sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully stir in honey, soy sauce, and salt.

In a serving bowl, combine honey mixture and drained pasta. Let pasta sit and come to room temperature, tossing occasionally so that the liquid gets absorbed.

Just before serving, top with cilantro, peanuts, scallions, and sesame seeds.

## Lisa's notes
