## Ingredients

For the beans: 

- 1 medium yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 (about 15-ounce) cans cannellini or butter beans
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 packed cups)
- 2 1/2 cups marinara sauce (about 20 ounces)
- 8 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese (about 2 cups)

For the toppings: 

- 4 sprigs fresh basil
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (about 1 ounce), plus more for serving
- Red pepper flakes (optional)
- Honey (optional)
- Garlic bread
- Any other toppings you want - anaheim peppers, olives, pepperoni, etc

## Instructions

Arrange a rack in the top third of the oven and heat the broiler.

Halve and thinly slice 1 medium yellow onion (about 1 1/4 cups). Thinly slice 2 garlic cloves. Drain 2 (about 15-ounce) cans cannellini or butter beans, but don’t rinse.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium (10-inch) broiler-proof skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Reduce the heat to medium. Add 5 ounces baby spinach in two batches, and stir until just wilted. Add the beans and 2 1/2 cups marinara sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to bubble, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Sprinkle with 8 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese.

Transfer the skillet to the oven. Broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, pick the leaves from 4 fresh basil sprigs and tear if large (about 1/2 cup loosely packed).

Sprinkle the beans with 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, then garnish with the basil leaves and red pepper flakes if desired. Drizzle with honey if desired. Serve with garlic bread and more grated Parmesan cheese.
