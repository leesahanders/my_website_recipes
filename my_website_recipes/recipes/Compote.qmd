# Japanese softly dried Persimmon with raising and ginger compote

My friend M George sent us back some dried persimmons while he was travelling in Japan. This was an incredible way to try them 

## Ingredients

- 3 dried persimmons chopped
- 1/2 cupt golden raisins 
- 1/4 c sugar brown sugar 
- 1 tsp microplaned ginger at the beginning, another 1/4 tsp at the end
- 1 cinnamon stick 
- Microplane the end of a nutmeg (likely 1/4 tsp) 

## Instructions

Add  all ingredients except spices into pot. Cover just barely with water. Add a cinnamon stick. Add spices while it comes up to temp. Bring to a boil. Turn it down and let simmer. 

At the end microplane another 1/4 tsp ginger so there is fresh ginger flavor 

Serve over pancakes, waffles, ice cream, or even just eat plain. Good warm or cold. 

## Lisa's notes

We combined together three different recipes:

- <https://www.thespruceeats.com/dried-fruit-compote-2122158>
- <https://norioonwine.blogspot.com/2021/04/japanse-dried-hoshigaki-persimmon.html?m=1>

It tastes reminiscent of gingerbread or the holidays.
