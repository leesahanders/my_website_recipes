## At a Glance

SERVES 4 TO 6

## Ingredients

2 tablespoons olive oil

6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each)

4 small leeks, light green and white parts thinly sliced (see How to Clean Leeks, opposite)

6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1/4 cup dry white wine

3/4 cup wild rice blend

2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves

1 3/4 cups chicken broth (page 20)

3/4 cup jasmine rice

1/4 cup chopped golden raisins

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Lemon wedges, for serving

Sour cream, for serving

## Instructions

1. In a 12-inch straight-sided oven-safe skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook until the skin is deep golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, skin side up, cover, and set aside. Pour off all except for 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan.

2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the leeks and garlic to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until the leeks begin to soften and turn golden, 3 to 6 minutes. Add the white wine and cook until the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the wild rice blend, thyme, and chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.

3. Add the jasmine rice, raisins, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and 1½ cups of water to the skillet, and bring the mixture back to a boil. Return the thighs to the skillet, skin side up, cover the skillet, and transfer it to the oven. Cook until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is almost tender, about 25 minutes. Then remove the lid and cook for another 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges and dollops of sour cream.
