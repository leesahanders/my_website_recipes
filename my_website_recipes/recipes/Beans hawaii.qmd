## At a Glance

Do you like hawaiian pizza? Then you are going to love this! If you don't, get out of here ya silly milly

## Ingredients

- cooking oil
- 1 small onion chopped
- 1 red bell pepper diced into large chunks
- 2 tsp ginger-garlic paste
- chili powder to taste
- 1 can chopped tomatoes
- 1 can pineapple chunks
- 2 cans black beans rinsed and drained
- cooked rice for serving

## Instructions

Heat up some oil in a pot or a big saucepan, add onions to the pot. Once the onions are getting translucent, add the bell pepper and roast a bit.

Add your cumin and chili and once it starts getting fragrant, add your ginger-garlic. Stir properly, so it doesn’t burn.

Toss in canned tomatoes, the pineapple chunks including juice and the beans. Add salt and heat to taste.

Bring to boil and cook until the peppers are cooked through but still firm. It should take about five minutes.

Serve over warm rice.
