## Ingredients

300 g peas
50 g bacon cut into pieces
50 g chouriço cut into coins
1 small onion diced
2 cloves garlic minced
200 g canned tomatoes
1 bayleaf
4 eggs
salt & pepper to taste
fresh cilantro for garnish
bread for serving

## Instructions

In a pan fry the bacon pieces.

When crispy, put in the onion, garlic, bayleaf, chouriço, salt and pepper and let it sweat.

After the onion is translucent, put the tomatoes in and let it cook for around 10 minutes.

Then put the peas in and let it cook until tender, if necessary put a little water in, should be saucy.

Make little wells in the peas and put an egg in each one and cover until the egg whites set but the yolk is still liquid.

Serve sprinkled with cilantro and with bread to dip in.
