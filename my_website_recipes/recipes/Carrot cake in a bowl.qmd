## Ingredients

- 1⁄2 cup old-fashioned oats
- 2 Tbsp diced dried carrots / or same grated carrots (the more carrots the better)
- 3 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp raisins
- 2 Tbsp dry milk
- 1⁄4 tsp ground cinnamon
- Pinch fine sea salt
- 2 Tbsp shredded coconut


## Instructions

At home:

(Optional - do this to make it more "cake" like, or keep as is for more of an oatmeal experience) Whirl the oats in a blender until about ⅓ of the original size. 

Put them in a quart freezer bag. Process the carrots in the same manner, adding them to the bag along with the other dry ingredients.

In camp:

Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil in your pot. Add the dry ingredients, stirring well, and bring back to a boil. Remove the pot from the stove, cover tightly, and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir well and top with coconut.

Notes:

For a less strong carrot taste, only use 1 Tablespoon.
Use coconut, rice, or soy milk powder for a vegan version.
This recipe was featured in the Washington Trails Magazine, January/February 2011 issue.

## Lisa's notes

At home I baked it for 15 min at 325 (the "reheat" setting) so the oats would cook a bit. This would be absolutely stellar camping.
