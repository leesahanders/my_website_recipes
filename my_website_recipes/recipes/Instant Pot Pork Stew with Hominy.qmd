## Ingredients

1 pound pork shoulder, cut into bite-size cubes

1 medium (8 oz) yellow onion, chopped

One (25-ounce) can hominy, undrained

3/4 cup water

3 or 4 garlic cloves, chopped

1 to 3 canned chipotle chiles in adobo, chopped, with 1 to 2 teaspoons adobo sauce from the can (about 1/2 small can)

2 teaspoons ancho chile powder, plus more if needed

2 teaspoons ground cumin

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more if needed

1/4 cup fresh cilantro, for garnish (omit or use parsley instead)

## Instructions

In the insert of an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, combine the pork, onion, hominy and its juices, water, garlic, chipotle chiles, adobo sauce, ancho chile powder, cumin, oregano, and salt.

TESTER TIP: If you like your hominy more al dente, add half the can while cooking so it flavors and thickens the stew a bit, and save the other half to add after cooking.

Secure the lid on the Instant Pot or pressure cooker. Close the pressure-release valve. Cook over high pressure for 30 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, allow the pressure to release naturally, 15 to 20 minutes. The pork should be very tender.

Taste the stew and season with additional ancho chile powder and salt, if needed. Garnish with the cilantro and serve.
