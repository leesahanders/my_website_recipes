## Instructions

In a bowl, combine 2 chicken breasts, 1 tsp paprika, ½ tsp chili powder, ½ tsp dried oregano, ½ tsp dried parsley, ¼ tsp rosemary, ½ tsp onion powder, ½ tsp garlic powder,Salt and black pepper. Marinate for at least 20 minutes.

Preheat a stainless steel pan. Test if it’s ready by sprinkling a few drops of water. If the droplets dance and form beads, your pan is hot enough.

Add 1 tbsp olive oil to the pan, then place the chicken breasts down. Cook for about 6 minutes per side, or until golden and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).

OPTIONAL –  Once done, baste the chicken with 1-2 tbsp Butter right at the end for extra richness.

Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes to keep it juicy. Then, cut into bite sized chunks or slices.

Cut 4 ears fresh corn kernels off the cob. In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tbsp butter and add the corn. Season with ½ tsp paprika, ½ tsp chili powder, Salt and pepper to taste. Sauté for 6–8 minutes until slightly charred and fragrant. Let cool.

Whisk together 3 tbsp mayonnaise (or Greek yogurt), 1 tbsp lemon juice,½ tsp garlic powder, ½ tsp paprika, ¼ tsp chili powder, 1 tbsp olive oil, Salt and pepper in a bowl until smooth.

In a large bowl, combine cooked corn, chopped 1 whole cucumber, ½ red onion, 2 jalapeños, 1 handful fresh cilantro, and grilled chicken. Pour over the creamy dressing and toss until everything is evenly coated.
