## Ingredients

- Italian sausage 2 lbs 
- Get two jars of red pasta sauce (basil and garlic is good) 
- 2 carrots 
- 2 peppers (Anaheim, poblano both good) 
- 1 box of noodles (12 oz, we like the Jovial bow tie) 
- Collared greens 2 bunches 
- 2-4 cloves of garlic 
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper

## Instructions

Cook noodles according to directions 

When noodles are done, rinse under cold water and add some old when transferring back to pan so they don't clump. 

Cut the collared greens so that the stems and leaves are separate 

Finely minced garlic

Cook the stems and the garlic together until somewhat soft 

Add leaves (shredded so they are small) 

Cook until leaves are wilted but not soggy (I want to chew my food) 

Cut carrots and peppers

Brown the meat 

Add the carrots and let go for a little while

Add peppers and sauce 

Let simmer until delicious 

Serve with love
