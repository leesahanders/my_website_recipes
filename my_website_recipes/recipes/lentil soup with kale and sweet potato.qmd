## Ingredients

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 medium (6 1/2 oz) onion, cut into small dice

2 large garlic cloves, minced

8 ounces store-bought or homemade fresh chorizo sausage, casings removed

One (14-ounce) sweet potato, peeled and diced

4 cups store-bought canned chicken broth or homemade chicken stock

2 cups water

8 ounces Lacinato kale, stemmed and thinly sliced

3/4 cup red lentils

1 to 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar or fresh lemon juice

Kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

In a large heavy-bottomed pot set over medium-low heat, warm the oil. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and softened, 6 to 8 minutes.

Increase the heat to medium, add the chorizo, and cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until itâ€™s no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss in the sweet potato and cook, stirring frequently, for another 2 to 3 minutes.

Stir in the chicken broth and water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes begin to soften, about 10 minutes.

Stir in the kale and the lentils and cook until the lentils are just tender but not mushy, 10 to 15 minutes more.

Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Lisa's notes

Very hearty soup (and a good way to use up leftover turkey, just sub for chorizo with some chipotle powder)
