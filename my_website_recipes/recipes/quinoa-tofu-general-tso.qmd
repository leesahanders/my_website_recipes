## Ingredients

- 1 oz ginger, peeled and minced
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- 3 tbsp low-sodium tamari
- 1 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar
- 10 oz organic extra firm tofu, patted dry and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 tbsp tuxedo sesame seeds (divided)
- 2 scallions, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 6 oz broccoli florets
- 6 oz precooked golden quinoa
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- Salt
- Pepper

## Instructions

Cooking Quinoa: do a 1 3/4 c ratio of water: 1 c Quinoa

1 Make the sauce
Bring large pot of salted water to a boil for broccoli. Whisk together ginger, garlic, tamari, sugar, and vinegar in medium bowl.

2 Crisp the tofu
Combine tofu, cornstarch, just 2 tsp sesame seeds, and a pinch of salt and pepper in large bowl and toss to coat. Heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add coated tofu and cook, tossing occasionally, until crispy and browned in places, 5 to 8 minutes.

3 Finish the tofu
Add scallion to skillet with tofu and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add sauce, and toss. Cook until sauce thickens, about 30 seconds.

4 Cook the broccoli and warm the quinoa
Add broccoli to boiling water and cook until tender and bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and add a pinch of salt and pepper. Make small tear at top of quinoa bag and microwave for 60 seconds. (TIP: You can also combine precooked quinoa and 1 tbsp water in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and steam until warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes.)

5 Serve
Divide warmed quinoa and cooked broccoli between large plates and top with General Tso’s tofu. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds.

## Lisa's notes

The sugar seemed too high, and the soy sauce too low so we swapped them and it was great. 

Double the recipe to have leftovers for the next day.
