## Ingredients

1 1/2 pounds chicken breast chopped into bite sized pieces
3 tablespoons corn starch or almond flour
1/4 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup Hoisin sauce or keto teriyaki sauce
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 clove garlic minced
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons oil to fry

dust with seseme seeds and green onion for maximum fanciness

## Instructions

In a small bowl, add the chicken and cornstarch and toss until coated. 
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, and water. 
Add the oil into a non-stick pan and place it over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes until no longer pink.
Add the sauce and mix until the chicken is coated. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened.
Remove the pan off the heat and sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions.

## Lisa's notes

So this is one of those recipes where I went wild to make it gluten free, here's what I ended up using: 

1/4 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tbs brown sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 clove garlic minced
1/2 cup water
