## At a Glance

Serves 4 to 6

## Ingredients

- 2tablespoons vegetable oil – use
- 1garlic clove, smashed and minced – 1 tsp
- 1tablespoon minced fresh ginger – 1 tsp
- 4scallions, white and green parts, minced, plus more for garnish
- 8ounces ground pork - omit
- 4cups store-bought or homemade chicken stock
- 1pound soft or firm tofu (not silken and not extra firm), cut into 1/2-inch cubes - omit
- 4 or 5medium button mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced (or substitute dried, rehydrated wood ear mushrooms) – use entire container
- 1teaspoon granulated sugar - stevia
- 2/3cups rice vinegar, or to taste – ½ cup white vinegar
- 3tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
- 1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1tablespoon sesame oil, plus more for garnish
- 1tablespoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste
- 2large eggs
- White or black pepper for garnish

## Instructions

1. In the saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic, ginger, scallions, and pork and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1 minute. You want to break up the pork into smaller pieces with a spoon, but don’t worry about breaking it down completely or cooking it through.
2. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Add the tofu, mushrooms, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, black pepper, sesame oil, and Sriracha sauce and bring the soup back to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste the soup. If you want it hotter, add more Sriracha sauce; if you want it more sour, add more vinegar.
3. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until blended. With the soup at a steady simmer, slowly whisk in the eggs so they form strands. Bring the soup back to a simmer. Divide the soup among 4 to 6 bowls and garnish each with a little sesame oil, scallion, and white or black pepper. Serve immediately. (Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. The soup may take on a slightly different appearance, but it will taste just the same.)
